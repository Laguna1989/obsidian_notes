# Summary
Great book, fully recommend reading this one. It is a rather advanced book that picks, reiterates and improves up some ideas from other books, e.g. [[The Pragmatic Programmer]], [[The Clean Coder]]
or [[Dependency Injection]]
# Things to remember
- Code is not an asset, it is a liability
- When editing code, the tests are your safety net. When editing tests, there is no safety net
- Abstraction is the elimination of the irrelevant and the amplification of the essential. 
- command query separation (cqs)
- cyclomatic complexity and code size (number of lines) are the only two metrics that matter
- Strangler pattern
- X-out names (functions, classes or variables) and see how much sense the code still makes
