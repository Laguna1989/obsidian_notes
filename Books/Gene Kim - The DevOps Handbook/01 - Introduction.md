# Excerpt

- DevOps Myths
    - Only for Start-ups
    - Replaces agile
    - Incompatible with ITIL or itsm
    - Incompatible with infosec
    - Eliminates Ops or means noops
    - Means Just Infrastructure as Code
    - Only for Open Source Software
- DevOps Shows the best way forward
- Problem: Deployments are not normal, take weeks or months and are performed only few times a year
- The core conflicting goals:
    - Respond to rapid changes (Dev)
    - Provide a stable, reliable and secure service (Ops)
- Downward spiral in three acts:
    - Act 1:
        - One of the core problems are complex, badly documented applications and infrastructure that are extremely fragile
        - This leads to technical debts and daily workarounds (which requires enormous cognitive load)
    - Act 2:
        - Someone has to compensate for a broken promise (e.g. product management promising a bigger feature for the last missed one)
        - This leads to more cutting corners and even more added technical debt
    - Act 3:
        - Work gets more coupled, everything gets more complicated (because of workarounds)
        - Feedback becomes slower
- Every company is a software company
- The Human cost: feeling powerless, burnout, high retention …
- Devops
    - Improves operational performance
    - Achieve the goals of all technical roles (security, safety, development, qa, …)
    - Improve the human condition
    - Everyone will work during normal working hours during the week
    - Create fast feedback loops thanks to fast automated tests in production like environments
    - Problems are immediately fixed when they are found
    - Everyone feels productive
    - (dark launch techniques <- lookup!) enabling features via easy switches?
    - Releases are controlled, predictable, reversible and low stress
    - Every fix creates organizational learning
    - Everyone is constantly learning, the scientific method is used and nothing is taken for granted
    - Instead of a culture of fear, we have a culture of high trust, collaborative, blame free culture with a lot of psychological safety
    - Everyone builds automated tests and uses peer reviews or even pair programming
    - Internal technology conferences teach new skills to everyone
    - Conduct planned fault injection (fuzz testing) into our system
    - Work matters and is meaningful

# Discussion & Questions

- What are your experiences for this book and for the book club?
- What of the DevOps myths mentioned have you heard or even experienced?
- What of the problems and challenges described on pages xxix ff. Have you encountered any of them yourself? How did you handle them?
- How many deploys a day are performed by your current team? How many developers does your team have? Now place your team in the Plot on Page xl. What Graph do you see your current team on?
- Now the same question for your complete project/product.
- Do you agree that the conflict between IT operations and Development is the root cause for the mentioned issues?

# Text for the Book Club

Hi everyone, great to have you! Welcome to the first week of the book club. Let’s read the book together. Please feel free to discuss any topic related to the book in this chapter. Of course it is highly appreciated to share your insights here. The live session meeting for this week will be posted shortly.

This week we are going to read the Introduction chapter. It starts out with some Devops Myths and describes the problem that DevOps is solving. Furthermore a first overview of DevOps is given.

As discussion starters I would like to propose the following questions

- What are your experiences for this book and for the book club?
- What of the DevOps myths mentioned have you heard or even experienced?
- What of the problems and challenges described on pages xxix ff. Have you encountered any of them yourself? How did you handle them?
- How many deploys a day are performed by your current team? How many developers does your team have? Now place your team in the Plot on Page xl. What Graph do you see your current team on?
- Now the same question for your complete project/product.
- Do you agree that the conflict between IT operations and Development is the root cause for the mentioned issues? Do you see other or additional reasons for those issues?
