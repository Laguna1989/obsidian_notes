- How Well do you think the concepts introduced(spotify's Tribe, google's SRE) are applicable to Automotive Software Development? And why?

# Text for Book Club Post

Welcome to the fourth week of the book club. This week we are going to read about static team topologies (pages 61 -78).

The chapter starts with describing anti-patterns, followed by some dev ops team topologies and successful team patterns.

This week I would like to discuss with you

- Which of the static Team types mentioned in the chapter do you recognize in your current Setup? Do they fulfill their purpose?
- How well do you think the concepts introduced - which mostly originate from some web services (e.g. spotify's Tribe, google's SRE) - are applicable to automotive software development? And why?
- How would you rate your Team’s capabilities for typical devops Tasks? What could be improved?
