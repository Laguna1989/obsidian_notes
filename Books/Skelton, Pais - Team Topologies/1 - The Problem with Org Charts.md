# Excerpt

- Bilding software is a team activity
- Balance speed and safety (consistency, quality?) of deliveries
- Org harts shows hierarchical ways of reporting and thus communication channels
- It’s even worse: org charts do not even show the actual communication

- Org chart based decisions are ineffective and aim for local optimization; org charts are always out of date
- Let’s do [[System Thinking]] instead of *org chart thinking*
- Team topologies focuses on setup of dynamic team structures and interaction modes
- Relying on a single, static organization structure is untenable.

- reverse conway maneuver: make the organization follow the desired architecture for the software
- Three elements of intrinsic motivation: autonomy, mastery, purpose

# Question Notes

- As org charts are apparently not helpful: Why do software companies and high tech corporations still use them so consistently?
- Do you use the org chart and what value does it actually bring to your daily work?
- page 11. states “The same happens for any one team by adding up the team member’s cognitive capacities”. Do you agree with this statement, explicitly that this is a linear relationship?
- Which of the obstacles to flow of figure 1.2 do you see currently applicable for yourself?

# Text for Book Club Post

Hello everyone and welcome to the first week of the “Team Topologies” book club. Great to have you!

Let’s embark on this learning-journey with the first chapter “The problem with org charts” (pages 0 - 13).

Before diving into the topics I would like to know what your expectations are for the book: What would you like to learn in this book? What are your reasons for joining?

The first chapter is about org charts and their problems. While they do show the hierarchical way of reporting, they often fail to show the actual communication between the teams. It further describes the three elements of intrinsic motivation for employees: autonomy, mastery, purpose. And finally Flow is discussed and some obstacles to flow are described.

For this chapter I would like to discuss the following questions with you:

- Do you use the org charts available and what value does it bring to you in your daily work? Does the org chart reflect the actual reality?
- Why do you think that companies still use org charts consistently, even though they do have quite a high number of problems?
- From the elements of intrinsic motivation: Which of those would you check for your current job and which not? What is the rationale for your evaluation?
- Let’s play “obstacles for flow”-bingo(figure 1.2). Which of the mentioned points do you see currently applicable to your team? Do you see other additional pain points? What are you doing about them?
