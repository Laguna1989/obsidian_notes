# Excerpt

- Team dynamics matter more than who is actually on the team
- Team definition: stable group of 5-9 who work towards a common goal
- Team Size
    - Close trustees: around 7-9 people. In bigger teams, the trust breaks down, leading to suboptimal decisions
    - Dunbar “circles” limit the number of participants in a team/project/valuestream

- Teams take time to form and be effective
- Stability needs to be provided for the team to form
- Teams should be stable, but not static
- Team Responsibilities
    - Every part of the codebase needs to be owned by exactly one team
    - Think of code as gardening, not policing
- A diverse mix of people in the team produces better results
- Rewarding individual performance leads to poor results and damaging behavior.
- Cognitive Load
    - Three types:
        - Intrinsic: How to create a class, …
        - Extraneous: How to deploy this service
        - Germane: how do we interface XYZ,...
    - To reduce cognitive load investigate the problem domains and split accordingly
    - domains can be simple, complicated and complex
    - Splitting process:
        - 1) One domain per team
        - 2) If too big, split domains into subdomains
        - 3) Team can have 2-3 simple domains
        - 4) If team has a complex domain, do not add other domains
        - 5) A team should have at max 1 complicated domain (+ potential simple domains)

    - tune the ecosystem to reduce cognitive load:
        - Team first environment
        - Minimize team distractions (limit meetings, reduce emails, …)
        - Eyes on, Hands off management
        - Increase DevEx
        - Use a platform that is designed to reduce cognitive load
- Minimize cognitive load for others
- Explicitly allocate time for learning across teams
- Office spaces should account for
    - high focused, undisturbed individual work
    - collaborative intra-team work and
    - collaborative (less frequent) inter-team work
- Continuous delivery (and other development practices) is king

# Questions

- How big is your current Team and how does this relate to Dunbar's number? How about a collection of Teams, and so on?
- On a range from 1 to 10, how would you rate the trust in your current team and why? What could be improved and how big is the team?
- How do you and your team cope with changes in the team setup? Any lessons learned?
- What type of cognitive load do you see your current team struggle the most? Why is that and what would you do against it?
- While I feel that Intrinsic cognitive load can be reduced by using the appropriate tools and individual learning, extraneous and germane load are things that are above my personal level of influence as a developer. How do you try to reduce those two types in your team?
- What action does your team take to actively minimize cognitive load for others (inter- or intra-team)?

# Text for Book Club Post

It is already week 3 of the book club. This week we are going to read chapter 3: Team-first thinking (pages 31 - 60). This chapter introduced Dunbar’s Number, Team responsibilities and the concept of cognitive load.

Some discussion starters for this week:

- How big is your current Team and how does this relate to Dunbar's number? How about a collection of Teams, and so on?
- On a range from 1 to 10, how would you rate the trust in your current team and why? What could be improved and how big is the team? What works well?
- How do you and your team cope with changes in the team setup? Any lessons learned?
- What type of cognitive load do you see your current team struggle the most? Why is that and what would you do against it?
- While I feel that Intrinsic cognitive load can be reduced by using the appropriate tools and individual learning, extraneous and germane load are things that are above my personal level of influence as a developer. How do you try to reduce those two types in your team?
