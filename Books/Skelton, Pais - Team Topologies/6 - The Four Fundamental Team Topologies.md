Fundamental Team Topologies

## Stream Aligned Team

> [!check] Stream Aligned Team
> - continuous flow of work aligned with the business
> - Primary team type
> - Can react quickly to feedback
> - Composed of generalists and some specialists
> - Behaviors:
> 	- Produces steady flow
> 	- Quick to act on feedback
> 	- Constantly learns and adapts
> 	- Minimal hands off
> 	- Evaluated based on sustainable flow and other tech or team metrics
> 	- Has time to account for technical debt
> 	- Reaches out to supporting (subsystem, platform and enabling) teams
> 	- Achieve autonomy, mastery and purpose

## Enabling Team

> [!check] Enabling Team
>  - Strongly collaborative
>  - Actively avoid becoming ivory tower teams
>  - Grow the capabilities for stream aligned teams
>  - Behaviors:
> 	 - Proactively seeks to understand the needs of stream aligned teams
> 	 - Stays ahead of the curve regarding tooling and practices
> 	 - Messengers of both good and bad news
> 	 - Can be a proxy for internal or external complex services
> 	 - promotes learning inside and outside of the enabling team
>  - Enabling team works fulltime, vs. [[Community of Practice]] only diffuse and parttime

## Complicated Subsystem Team

> [!check] Complicated Subsystem Team
> - Stream aligned teams can not have experts on all parts.
> - Decision to create this team is driven by cognitive load
> - Off-load work from the stream aligned team
> - Behaviors:
> 	- Aware of the current development stage
> 	- Higher delivery speed and quality of work
> 	- Prioritizes and delivers upcoming work respective of the needs of the stream aligned team.

## Platform Team

> [!check] Platform Team
> - Provides self-service api, tools, knowledge and support for a plattform
> - Enables the stream aligned team to be in full control of building, running and fixing their application.
> - Stream aligned teams can use the platform without indepth knowledge
> - Behaviors:
> 	- Strong collaboration with the stream aligned teams
> 	- Fast prototyping with feedback from stream aligned teams
> 	- Strong focus on usability and reliability
> 	- Use their platform internally if applicable
> 	- Understands that adoption of new platforms evolves over time

## Platforms

- should consider UX and DevEx and geht Out of the way of Dev teams
- should be treated as live production systems
- use software product management techniques
- tracks feature usage via metrics

## Conversion of Traditional Teams

- Infrastructure team should become a platform team
- Components teams -> platform/other team types
- Tooling teams -> Enabling teams
- architecture teams -> part time enabling team, decisions taken by the stream aligned teams

# Questions

- What type of team topology do you see yourself in?
- What type of team topologies are you missing in your current setup?
- What type of team topologies do you see mostly in our company?
- How are platforms in/around your team managed?
- How are architects set up in and around your product? Does this setup make sense for you?
- In this chapter it became especially apparent to me that most examples are from internet-era companies. How well do you think will the examples translate to an automotive company?

# Text for Book Club Post

Hi everyone to the fifth week of the book club. This week we are going to read chapter 5 “The four fundamental team topologies” (pages 79 - 110).

I would describe this chapter as the heart of the book, as it introduces the name-giving team topologies, namely: stream aligned teams, enabling teams, complicated subsystem teams and platform teams.

This week I would like to discuss with you:

- What type of team topology do you see yourself in?
- What type of team topologies are you missing in your current setup?
- What type of team topologies do you see mostly in our company?
- In this chapter it seemed to me that most examples are from internet-era companies. How well do you think the examples will translate to an automotive company?
