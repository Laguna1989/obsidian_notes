# Text for Book Club Post

Welcome to the 8th week of the book club. This week we are going to read Chapter 7 “Team interaction modes” (pages 131 - 152).

After the Team boundaries in the last chapter, this chapter goes into detail about the actual interactions between teams. There are three basic interaction modes: Close collaboration, X as a service and Facilitating.

The questions for this week are:

- In which ways does your team interact with other teams? Can they already be mapped to one of the discussed interaction modes?
- Which interaction mode(s) would you feel desirable with your peer-teams?
