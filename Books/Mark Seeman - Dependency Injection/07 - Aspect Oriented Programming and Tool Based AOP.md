Hi everyone, the book club is already entering the last third of its lifetime. This week we will read the chapters about aspect oriented programming (AOP) by design and tool based aspect oriented programming (pages 301 - 357).

The chapter starts with an recap of the [[SOLID Design Principles]] and shows how the solid principles enable AOP and can be used to prevent code duplication. Furthermore the [[Command Query Separation]] is introduced and cross cutting concerns (from last week) are discussed.

When talking about tool based AOP, the advantages and disadvantages are discussed.

My question this week would be if you have used tool based AOP and if so in which language. I am not mainly developing in C# but this seems a very specific technique to me.
