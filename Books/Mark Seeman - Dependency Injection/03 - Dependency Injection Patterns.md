# Text Week 3

Hi everyone. It is the third week of the book club. This week we are going to read chapter 4 “DI Patterns”, which corresponds to pages 83 to123.

After the examples from last week, common DI patterns are introduced, namely “Composition Root”, “Constructor Injection”, “Method Injection” and “Property Injection”.

This week I would like to discuss with you:

- Have you used any of the mentioned patterns already? Can you share an example?
- Why did you decide to go for that specific pattern?
- What problem did the respective pattern solve and was it helpful?
