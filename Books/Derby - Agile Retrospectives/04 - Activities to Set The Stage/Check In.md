# Instructions

- Set the stage in [[Retrospectives]]
- Ask one short question that can be answered with **just a word** or **a short phrase**
- Ask each participant to answer very briefly
- Example questions
	- What is one word that describes what you need for yourself from this session?
	- Describe in one or two words what is happening for you at the moment.
	- In one or two words, what are your hopes for this retro?
	- Are you [[Mad-Sad-Glad]]?
	- What is one thing that is on your mind?
		- Follow up: What do you need to do to put that concern to the side?
- Do not offer evaluative comments "good" or "wonderful"
