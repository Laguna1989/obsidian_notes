Make an **anonymous** poll if participants are in this as
- Explorers: eager to discover new ideas
- Shoppers: look at all information and will take home one useful idea
- Vacationers: not interested in the retro but lucky to get away from daily business
- Prisoners: Would rather be somewhere else
if the majority is vacationers, this should be the topic of the retro
If you have at least one prisoner tell them they can spend their time however they like, but the group will be poorer without their participation
