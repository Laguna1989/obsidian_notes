Steps:
- Post the flip chart
- Give team members 3-5 minutes to reflect privately on the iteration and to write notes
- Lead a brainstorming and record ideas. Keep going until all important comments have been posted (wait through one or two silences)
- Ask the team to identify the top 20% of the items. Those that have the potential for the greatest benefit
- Follow up with [[Dot Voting]]
- If there are more than two or three items, reduce them to a manageable few
- Keep the brainstormed list for future reference (or a historical review)

> [!note] Can also be used in [[08 - Activities to Close The Retrospective|Closing]] to reflect on the retrospective itself
