- Team members report on what is happening for them and what they want
- hear from others, do not comment
- Elements:
	- Appreciation (how others have contributed)
	- Puzzles (we don't understand but are curious)
	- New Info (anything interesting for the rest of the group)
	- Complaints (with recommendation, what they'd like different)
	- Hopes and wishes (what do we hope for?)
