# Part 1 - Foundations

## Chapter 1

> [!quote] I wasn't just coloring outside the lines -- I was entirely off the canvas

> [!quote] The most important thing is that you do what makes you happy. The point of life is to enjoy it.
>

> [!quote] Making art is the easiest and hardest thing in the world. It is completely free-form.

> [!quote] Every song ins western music is built from the same 12 notes

> [!quote] Practice is basically trying not to try. Putting in effort to make something effortless.

> [!quote] You don't have to get all set up first and then start creating. You should be creating at every point along your journey.

> [!quote] Execute now! Create now!

> [!note] Is there any part of your creative journey that you are postponing?
> What is the thing you can make *today* to make real progress?
>

> [!note] When was the moment you first felt powerful when making art?

## Chapter 2

> [!quote] What we shared was our otherness, not a common ground but an absence of it.

> [!quote] Music was simply the highest form of sound expression.

> [!note] What are the educational foundations of your creative life?

> [!quote] My creations became rough, sprawling masses of sound.

> [!quote] Music that is built on rejection doesn't have much of anything in it.

> [!note] How do your circumstances affect what and how you want to create?

> [!quote] True innovation serves a purpose and builds upon and improves what has come before.

> [!quote] Uniqueness for its own sake is usually empty of substance.

> [!quote] *Nobody is doing this!* - Yes, we know and there are several good reasons for that.

> [!quote] Throwing away map and compass doesn't mean North and South stop existing.

> [!quote] Figure out what is right for me by doing a lot of what was wrong for me.

> [!quote] There is a push and pull between what is expected and unexpected.

> [!quote] We want continuity - but a bit of surprise. Not a list of predictable sequence of events, nor a string of non-sequiturs.

> [!note] Within your field, what is something you have shied away from or never tried?

> [!quote] We grow from challenge. How can you stretch beyond your comfort zone when creating? While your efforts won't always turn into something immediately productive, experimentation almost always guarantees fresh discoveries about yourself and your process.

> [!note] Set aside time for one such exploration block this week!
> Take notes about the experiments. What was successful? What did you learn?

> [!note] Can you identify what interests and personality traits arose naturally within your environment? Which traits/ideals were instead reactions *against* the world you found yourself in?

> [!quote] The smoother path to fulfillment starts with clearing away the aspects of ourselves that are no longer -- or never were -- truly part of us.

# Chapter Three & Four

> [!quote] How did they manage to remove fun from music?

> [!quote] They have learned to follow, but not to forge anything new.

>[!quote] Approach things from every possible angle. Learning *both* formally and informally, on your own *and* from experts, through studying bokos *and* getting out into the world.

> [!note] Actively take notes while listening to music
