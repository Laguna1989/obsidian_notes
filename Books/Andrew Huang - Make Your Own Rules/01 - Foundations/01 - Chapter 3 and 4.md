>[!quote] Approach things from every possible angle. Learning *both* formally and informally, on your own *and* from experts, through studying bokos *and* getting out into the world.

> [!note] Actively take notes while listening to music

> [!quote] When musicians work well together the whole is fantastically greater than the sum of its parts

> [!note] Tools for Collaboration
> - **Maintain the creative flow**: Creative session follow one rule "there is no 'no'." If you don't like an idea, try to steer it in a different direction, but don't discuss why it does not work.
> - **Be attuned to peoples needs**: This includes always feeling heard, respected and valued.
> - **Try to be someone who's energy does not need to be managed**: If someone shoots down your idea, it doesn't mean you are bad.
> - **Communicate clearly and early about roles and ownership**: Ownership is either (fair share) or (single person pays the others)
> - **Know when the good outweighs the bad**: A project should at least have two of the three:
>   - good people (emphasize this)
>   - good work
>   - good money

> [!note] Creative Contradictions
> It helps to embrace contradictions.
> - **You need to Create and Destroy. There is Growth and Decay**: for every finished project there is a pile of unfinished projects. This is ok. They are the soil and fertilizer of new projects and you need to let go of bad ideas
> - **Making Art is both sacred and casual**: Take your creative time seriously, but also have fun while working
> - **Make a mess and craft and refine**: There is a time for exploring and a time for being very deliberate about the outcome.
> - **We are after some degrees of grittiness and polish**: filthy and clean are compliments, but sterile or messy are not.
> - **Collaboration and isolation are beneficial to the creative process**: You can be a social butterfly and a lone wolf.

> [!quote] Do everything possible!
