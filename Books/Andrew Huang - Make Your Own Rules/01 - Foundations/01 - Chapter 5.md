> [!quote] After writing your hundredth song you are better at it than when you write your first.

> [!quote] Music isn't job search where you are young and unemployed. If you are into making music and you have a spare hour or two every day where you can give it deliberate focus, powerful things can happen.

> [!note] Suggestions for a productive creative practice
> - **Create every day, judgement free**: Do just the creating. No editing, no polishing, no revisiting yesterdays work. Let brand new ideas happen
> - **Post finished work online every week**: You have to complete projects and you will receive judgement from others (this will push you to higher standards). Practice *finishing*.
> - **Timed challenges**: You will create a lot quickly and practice finishing, but without the need for publishing. It is also an option to create dedicated time-chops for individual tasks
> - **Plan your project and break it down**: Write an outline and decide on what you are aiming for. break it down into smaller pieces until you have individual steps to take.

> [!quote] Action can be more important than planning.

> [!quote] You will find answers you need by taking action, by making too many mistakes rather than too few decisions.

> [!quote] If you are not going forward, you are going backward.

> [!quote] A post that says nothing except to ask people to click a link? Just throw out the link and a video of you dancing will get more of the results you want.

> [!quote] People engage with fun!
