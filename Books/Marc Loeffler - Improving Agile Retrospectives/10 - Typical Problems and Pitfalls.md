# Poor Preparation

> [!quote] A retrospective is a meeting but has very little in common with common meetings

> [!quote] Good preparation is half the battle

# A Lot of Discussions but no Results

## Conflicting Opinions

If there are two conflicting opinions, state both of them in your own words and suggest to try out both options, one after another as experiments to see which one brings better results

It can very well happen that both do not bring the desired results and you need to consider other options.

## Indecision

Make sure that each experiment is examined in the next retro and has a clear responsible person and time frame.

## The lack of a Clear time Frame

Get a feeling (by experience) for which discussions still bring value and which discussions run in circles endlessly

# Too Many Results

- Be careful when making changes. Remember: complex system, nonlinear interactions
- A single change is way easier to evaluate than many large changes
- Time is a limiting factor. Project work vs improvement work

> [!note] Use Dot Voting to decide which action items are worth exploring

# Disinterest in (Further) Improvement

Possible causes:
- Improvements from previous retros were never implemented (e.g. got lost in day-to-day business)
- Previous improvements had no effect
- The team didn't have enough time to work on the chosen improvements for them to become effective

# Focus on the Negative

- Retros should focus on improvements
- It is ok to talk about problems, but this should be directly linked to solutions
- Better: Stop/Start/Continue or [[Mad-Sad-Glad]]

# Focus on Factual Topics

- No simple solutions exist for complex problems.
- At some point the low hanging fruits are gone and you need to do hard work to fix any new issues
