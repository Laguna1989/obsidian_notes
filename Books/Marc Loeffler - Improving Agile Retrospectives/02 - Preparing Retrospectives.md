# Preparation

## What Period of time Should Be Discussed?

- 2-4 weeks for heartbeat retros
- Not more than 12 months

## Who Should Take part

- Everyone involved in the project
- The team should have the decision who takes part (e.g. PO, people from the outside)

## Is there a Topic?

- Most likely none for heartbeat retrospectives
- If there is a topic, announce it well before

# The Right Time, the Right place

- Use the same time (e.g. every second week on Tuesday),
- vary the room if appropriate (can give a new perspective)

# The Right Material

Be prepared, test stuff ahead

# Food

- No wedding without food
- gummi-bears, small pretzels, grapes, ...

Benefits are huge
- Relaxed atmosphere
- Better results
- Increased popularity of your retrospectives
- Less stomach rumbling

# Agenda

- Meetings with no agenda are largely inefficient
- Know the activities and have a (shorter) backup activity at hand
