 Large changes, especially on a company wide level are daunting

# Agile Change Management

- A clear Vision and Mission to describe the goal of the change
- A clear understanding of the organizations current condition
- A broad understanding of change processes in general
- An iterative process that helps to implement the change step by step
- Regular reflection that enables you to steer the process effectively and to adapt if necessary

# Initiating Change

The Kick-Off Meeting can be structured like a retrospective with the [[The Extended Retrospective Phase Model]].
