# Overview

A collection of alternative Retrospective approaches

# Work Retrospective

## Set The Stage

- Any Activity to set the stage
- Preferred Activity: [[Check In]]

## Gather Data

- Normally you gather data e.g. about the last two weeks. The Work Retrospective is different!
- Give the participants sticky notes and ask them to write down two activities that
	- take max 1h and
	- need to be addressed
- Everyone gets to present their ideas
- After that groups of two form who want to work on one of the ideas
- You can either find your partner first and then decide on a task or the other way around

## Work Phase

- Now is the time to actually do the work
- Strictly adhere to the time limit
- After the hour, everyone gets to give a short (2-5min) presentation to the whole team

## Experiences

- There are people who hate this (its the same that complain they never get time to work on things)
- There might be some cheaters (showing stuff they had been working on secretly before). This is fine, the Work retrospective is about getting things done
- If people go overtime, tell them they can not demo if they go overtime

# Fortune Cookie Retrospectives

The best retros have two things in common
- Something to eat
- Questions that challenge you

Prepare Fortune cookies (can be ordered online with custom texts or made by yourself)

# Powerful Questions

- Rather a coaching tool
- Collection of Questions that have no simple answer but want to get people thinking
- Good for Set the Stage or Gather Data

> [!example] A team member is going on about something that happened months before
> **Weak**: Why we still talking about about that? (Implying "cut it out")
> **Strong**: What can we learn from that?

Other examples:
- What can we afford to leave out?
- What is something that already works and that you can build on?
- What would your hero say?
- What is today's theme tune?
- What is not being said?
- What is giving us the most value?
- What is the worst that can happen?
- How can we minimize the risks?
- How is the team going to be perceived from the outside?
- How can we create a learning space?
- How often have we left our most pressing problem to one side?
