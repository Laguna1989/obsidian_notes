# Overview

- When teams start to work agile, it works out nicely at first
- After all the low hanging fruits there is little left that the team can improve on themselves
- The progress and benefits from working agile grind to a halt
- Working in a big company makes the team only a small part of a big system
- This imposes quite some limitations to the team's freedom
- Two tools needed for teams are [[System Thinking]] and [[Complexity Thinking]]

# Systems

> [!info] System based on Greek "Systema": Composite, made of connected parts, generally designates a totality of interrelated elements

> [!example] The definition of a system is often not clear
> Bar:
> - What exactly is a bar?
> - Are the people part of the bar?
> - Is the beer a part of the bar?
> - What happens when I have drunk my beer? Is it still part of the bar?
> - If I take my bear outside, is it still part of the bar?
> - Is the bar actually a system? What is the goal of the bar?

## Static Vs Dynamic Systems

- Static systems are mostly human-created
- Dynamic systems contain the changes for their own alteration
