>[!hint] Work out CLDs and keep them for reference in the next Retro

> [!hint] Tips for CLDs
> - Always use Nouns for variable names
> - Use Variables that are quantitatively measurable
> - Take unintended effects into account (increase flow might get higher productivity but also increased stress?)
> - Balancing Loops always have a goal. The goal must be part of the loop
> - If a connection is requires too much explanation, either rename or insert an intermediate step
