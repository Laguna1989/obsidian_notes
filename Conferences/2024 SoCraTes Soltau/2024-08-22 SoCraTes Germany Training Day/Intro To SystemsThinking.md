- Everyone starts at a different level
- [[System Thinking]] is a lifetime of learning
- A multitude of practices combined together
- Emerging community thinking "what the hell do I do in this new environment???"
- Workshop is about systems thinking questions, not so much about answers
- We need to develop system thinking language
- *What we think is true* is the biggest blocker
- Asking questions can be very challenging in a lot of corps
- Learning when to use systems thinking is important (if your sink is leaking you do need a wrench, not systems thinking)

- Summary: Small changes can have a big impact (small does not mean easy)
	- prioritize safety over comfort
- Working Agreement:

## Understand Core Concepts

- We don't model the whole iceberg (Most of the time we are reacting to events, not the root cause)
- We are (probably) blaming the wrong things
- We are experiencing counter-intuitiveness

- Visible events arise out of invisible patterns, structures and mental models
	- If you fix the bug in production, you did not solve the issue
- The iceberg model (see below)
- The real system is our construction of systematic thought itself
- Visible events arise out of our own mental models
- "The issues arise from inside the house"
- If a factory is torn down, but the the rationality for the factory remains, the rationality will simply produce another factory
- Socio-technical systems: two-way interaction between people and technology
- Ask yourself: What rationality would you want to change?

### Blockers in Systems Thinking

ST is a different tool everyone has very little experience with
- Blame
	- whenever something goes wrong, we start to blame.
	- We look at the cause and resort to blame
		- when in pain we look for quick fixes to move the discomfort
	- We always blame the wrong thing
	- -> Shifting the burden
	- Insanity is doing the same thing again and again and expecting different results
		- We are having new discussions but not moving as a group at all
- Counter-Intuitiveness
	- Leverage points are points within a system where a small shift in one thing can produce big changes in others
- We make it worse
	- People often know where to find leverage, but they change it in the wrong direction
	- Adding manpower to a late software makes it later -> [[The Mythical Man Month]]

## Use the Iceberg Model

- Iceberg model systems thinking (almost everything is invisible)
	- What is happening? Events (the only visible things)
	- What trends are there over time? Patterns and Trends
	- How are the patterns related? Structure
	- What values + Beliefs shape the system? Mental Models
		- Mental models do not change until we explicitly force ourselves into changing them

### Example

- Catching a cold at a conference
- Pattern: "con crud", "drupal fru"
- Structres: people from all over the world, no refunds, Masking (or not), missing ventilation systems, people huddled together
- Mental models: Sunk cost fallacy, "I'm here to network", "It won't happen to me"

Building a system where nobody catches a cold:
- Patterns: Plenty of rest, healthy food, spacious events
- Structures: Ventilation systems, remote option, refunds,
- Mental Model: "I want everybody to be able to enjoy this", "I want to be able to do this often"

The iceberg model helps us by giving more options

## The Current System

- 77% of Software developers are men
- 92% of CTO positions are held by men
- 92% of Devs worldwide are men
- 95% of Open Source contributions are from men

Strong decline in women dropped between 1980 and 1985
- Reason: Personal Computers were marketed as a male toy

Exercise: what Patterns, Structures and Mental models can lead to this outcome?
