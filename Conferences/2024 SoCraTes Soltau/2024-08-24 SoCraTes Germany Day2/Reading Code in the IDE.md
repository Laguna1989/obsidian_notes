# Overview

Follow up to [[Code Reading]]
- Developer advocate at jetbrains

# Intro

Dealing with lack of knowledge
- create a list
- research
- memorise (if relevant)

Lack of information
- unknown details
- unfamiliar names
- code connected in unknown ways
- too many things at once
Dealing with lack of information
- chunking/bunching (one can only keep 7 things in your brain at one time)

Lack of processing power
- memory aids
- dependency graph (what we did at the code reading wokshop)
- state table

Four dimensions of code reading
- structure:
	- code is not read linearly
- Domain
	- Behaviour and Data
- Concepts
	- Programming and domain concepts
- Context
	- How did it came to be this way?

- general
	- draw your own diagrams
- jetbrains
	- intellij presentation assistance
	- structure view (very good for yaml)
	- search and navigate (go to declaration)
	- bookmarks can have different icons
- keyboard shortcuts
	- `shift shift` opens command window
	- `ctrl alt s` go to settings
	- `ctrl shift f12` - Hide all Windows
	- `ctrl alt 1` go to terminal
	- `ctrl m, s` collapse all
- Actions
	- *show diagram* action
	- clion has a *learn* functionality
	- *dependency matrix* (only available for intellij)
- concepts
	- Restructure code: Move code around (also in blocks)
	- explain with ai assistant (also for commit messages)
