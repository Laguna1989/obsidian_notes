# Overview

The **Triangle Game** is a [[Retrospectives]] activity that makes the nonlinear behavior of complicated systems visible.

It is closely related to [[System Thinking]] and [[Complexity Thinking]].

# Instructions

1) You need at least 5 Participants, more is better
2) You need a reasonably large space
3) Each participant secretly and randomly selects two other participants
4) Now tell them: Without any communication, you need to arrange yourself in the physical space, so that you form an equilateral Triangle with your two selected peers.
5) Wait until all people have settled and do not move anymore.
6) Ask if everyone is happy with their position

# Closing Remarks

- Although the local topology is "simple", the team will normally take quite some time to find an equilibrium
- In complex systems you have way more than two constraints, thus the interactions will get way trickier
- Small changes on one side can cause a massive effect on the other side of the room
	- This is true for positive and negative changes alike
- Ask the participants to visualize the the final equilibrium in contrast to the phase of movement.
