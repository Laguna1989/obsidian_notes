Letâ€™s use the specification pattern
- Create two new classes: `Specification` and `Filter`
- Use inheritance to extend without modifying existing code

Introduce `BetterFilter` that does not need to be modified anymore

Now we can create and combine `Specification`s, e.g.

- With this we can also write a `Specification` for Size or a `Specification` combination, like `AndSpecification`
- Note that most `Specification` are very generic, but combinations can be combined
