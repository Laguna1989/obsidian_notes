# Overview

It is necessary to consider two distinct features of systems: Structure and Behavior.

# Structure

Can be
- Simple = easy to understand
- Complicated = very hard to understand

# Behavior

Can be
- Ordered = completely predictable
- Complex = partly predictable, with the odd surprise
- Chaotic = completely unpredictable
