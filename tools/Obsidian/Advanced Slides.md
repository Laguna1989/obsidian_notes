# Notes and Good Practices

- Use Separator `---` to create new slides
- Set the Slide transition style in the settings
- Avoid too much text on each slide as the font size is rather big
- Fragmentation (frame build-up) can be done via

```markdown
- Always Visible 
- Pops up later <!-- element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Pops up even later <!-- element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Again Always Visible
```
