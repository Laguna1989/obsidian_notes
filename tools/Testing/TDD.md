# Overview

> [!note] TDD = Test Driven Development

Development practice that consists of three distinct phases
1) **red**: write a failing test case
2) **green**: make that test pass
3) **refactor**: remove duplication in code and tests

> [!check] TDD allows for very fast iteration times

# Notes

- Try to do baby steps
- Try to stay in green as much as possible
