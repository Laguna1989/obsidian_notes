# Text for Week4

Hello dear members of the book club. We are already in week 4 of the book club. This week we are going to read about DI Anti-Patterns (page 124-163).

The Anti-Patterns introduced in this week are Control-Freak, Service Locator, Ambient Context and Constrained Construction.

I would like to discuss with you:

- Have you noticed any of the anti-patterns in your current or previous project? In which way are/were they harmful?
- Were you able to refactor or at least mitigate the effects of the anti-pattern?
