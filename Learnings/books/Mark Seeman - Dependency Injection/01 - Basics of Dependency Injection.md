# Text Week 1

Hello everyone and welcome to the first week of the book club. Great to have you. Let’s embark on our journey with the first chapter of “Dependency Injection”.

This week we are going to read Chapter 1: “The basics of Dependency Injection: What, why and how” (pages 1-34).

Before you start reading, I would like to ask you to share your expectations for the book and the book club. Do you already have some understanding of or even hands-on experience with dependency injection? Or is DI a topic which is completely new to you?

While and after reading this week's chapter it would be great to discuss with you:

- Are you familiar with any of the myths about DI mentioned in the book?
- The text mentions the [[SOLID Design Principles]]. Are you familiar with them and can you list them?
- The concept of volatile and stable dependencies is introduced. Think about any project you work(ed) on. How would the dependencies be classified and have any dependencies (especially the volatile ones) caused problems for you?
