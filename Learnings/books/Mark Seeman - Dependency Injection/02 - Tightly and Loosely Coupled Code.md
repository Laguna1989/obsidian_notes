# Questions

- What are the issues in the tightly coupled example?
- How are those issues removed by loose coupling?
- The tightly coupled example starts with an inside-out approach from the database layer. How would you approach the task inside-out and avoid the issues?

Possible Exercises
- Follow the two examples in your IDE

# Text Week 2

Hello everyone. It is the second week of the bookclub. This week we are going to read chapter 2 and 3 “Writing tightly & loosely coupled code”, which corresponds to pages 34 to 80.

This week’s content is all about examples. I strongly recommend you to open your IDE when reading the book and follow the example projects while reading.

This week I would like to discuss with you:

- There are quite some issues with the tightly coupled code mentioned in the book. Could you find additional ones?
- Does it make sense to you how those issues are avoided by using loosely coupled code?
- The tightly coupled example starts with an inside-out approach and it is stated that using an outside-in approach gives quicker feedback. What would you do if you work on this problem with an inside-out approach to get reasonably fast feedback, too?
