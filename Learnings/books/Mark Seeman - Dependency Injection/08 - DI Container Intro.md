Hi everyone,

sorry for the vacation-induced late post this week.This week will mark the final chapter that we will read together. It introduces DI Containers (pages 359 - 392).

This chapter is all about DI Containers. You will learn when to use them, how to configure them and what the basic concepts of those containers are.

My question this week is if you have used DI Containers already in one of your projects and what your experience was.
