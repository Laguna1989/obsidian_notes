## Introdution

- No matter the circumstances, you can always improve.
- You can always start improving with yourself.
- You can always start improving today.

## What is XP?

- Social change
- Letting go of old habits that once were “adaptive”
- Getting past “I know better than anybody else”
- Writing great code that is beneficial for the business
- **Do your best and then deal with the consequences**
- Based on values:
    - Communication
    - Feedback
    - Simplicity
    - Courage
    - Respect
- Practices are chosen as an expression of values
- XP is a path to Excellence for people developing software
- Crucial:
    - Short development cycles
    - Incremental planning
    - Ability to flexibly schedule
    - Automated tests
    - Oral communication, test and sourcecode to communicate system structure and intent
    - Evolutionary design process
    - Close collaboration of actively engaged individuals
- XP can be described as
    - XP is lightweight
    - XP is a methodology for constraints of software development, Not portfolio mangement/financial justification
    - XP can work with any team size
    - XP adapts to vague and rapidly changing requirements but can be applied for stable requirements

## Learning to Drive

- Stay aware. Adapt. Change
- Change will happen anyway. The problem is our inability to cope with change.

## Principles

- Values are too abstract to directly guide behavior.
- Humanity: People develop software
- Needed by people to be good developers:
    - Basic Safety
    - Accomplishment
    - Belonging
    - Growth
    - Intimacy
        - Split your topics to talk about into three parts: private (only family) personal (people who have gained trust) and public (everyone else)
- Mind the economics. If it doesn’t earn money, it is not good
- Work towards mutual benefit
- You need to solve more problems than you create, then people will listen to you.
- Improvement: “perfect” is a verb, not an adjective.
- Whole Team. Avoid Splitting or fractional belonging
- Software development is a game of insights, and insights come to those prepared, rested and relaxed.
- Pair Programming: Tiring but satisfying
