    * Intimacy
        * Split your topics to talk about into three parts: private (only family) personal (people who have gained trust) and public (everyone else)

* Work towards mutual benefit
* You need to solve more problems than you create, then people will listen to you.
* Improvement: “perfect” is a verb, not an adjective.
* Whole Team. Avoid Splitting or fractional belonging
* Software development is a game of insights, and insights come to those prepared, rested and relaxed.
* Pair Programming: Tiring but satisfying
