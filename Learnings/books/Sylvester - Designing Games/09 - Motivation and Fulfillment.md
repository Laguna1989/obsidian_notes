## 09 Motivation and Fulfillment
### Excerpt

* We want things because they feel good
* We can want something without liking it and like something without wanting it &lt;- so deep :o
* The main way to generate motivation is by anticipation of rewards
* Virtual rewards don’t have the same intensity as real rewards (money, status, safety, …)
* Timing the rewards is important: Reinforcement Schedule
* The reinforcement schedule is a system of rules that define when rewards are given
    * Fixed Ratio
        * Get a gold piece every time you defeat an orc
        * Get 10 gold pieces for every 10th orc
        * Poor motivation
    * Variable Ratio
        * 10% chance for 10 gold pieces on every orc
        * Good motivation
    * Fixed Interval Ratio
        * Health Pack reappears after 60 seconds
        * Low motivation
    * Variable Interval Ratio
        * Health Pack appears after random time
        * Medium motivation
    * Differential with low response rate:
        * Timer is reset if player triggers too early
    * Differential with high response rate:
        * Player must do X in a certain amount of time
* Superimpose reinforcement schedules so that at least one is active at all times
* Rewards (extrinsic motivation) can destroy the intrinsic motivation
* Reward alignment: How closely the activities encouraged by the reward system resemble those the player would have engaged without it.
* If the reward system matches the player’s intrinsic motivation, extrinsic and intrinsic motivation add up
* It is ok to not use any reward system (e.g. Dwarf Fortress)
* Player’s remorse: The player plays time but is not fulfilled by the game.
### Questions/Discussion

* Unendlicher Spass
* Superimposed Reinforcement schedules e.g. in PoE: Als Spieler WOLLTE ich z.B. die Mine grinden, aber das Spiel hat mich nicht gelassen. Da hatte es mich eher gestört
* Extrinsic motivation destroying intrinsic motivation: Ja genau das für “Ich will nicht mein Geld mit Musik/Gamedev verdienen müssen”
* Reinforcement schedules von bekannten Spielen? Rimworld? Serious Sam? Obra Dinn? Witcher 3? Skyrim? Max Payne? Minecraft?
