# Excerpt

- Games look like film, but they do not work like films
    - Films are not interactive
    - Other interactive media: Interactive exhibits or plays
- A narrative tool is some device to form a piece of story in a player’s mind
    - Games are broader as they have art, text,images and sound
    - Games have mechanics, which are unique to the medium
    - Scripted story, world narrative and emergent story
- Scripted Story: The events that are prerecorded and always play the same way
    - Cutscene or scripted sequence
    - Take away control of the player
- World Narrative
    - Aka environmental Storytelling
    - Avoids the problem of interactivity (as it occurs in scripted events)
    - Helps with World Coherence
- Emergent story
    - The story that is generated during play by the interaction of game mechanics and players
    - Narrative tool (designer authors the gameplay mechanics) and technology to generate content (offloads the work of authorship from the designer)
    - Emergent Story can surpass the game (beating your brother in a game after hard training)
- Apophenia: Finding Patterns where there are none, e.g. with personality “a desk lamp is afraid of the ball”
- Labeling: Giving things names to make them unique
- Abstraction: Showing players less leaves room for apophenia to fill in the gaps
- Record keeping: record game events for the player to look up. Dwarf Fortress History
- Sportscaster: Also very important for esports
- Story Ordering: Different Story Structures
    - Linear O->O->O-> … (quake, super mario, starcraft)
    - Star Like (mega man, …)
    - Branching

Agency:

- Have a stage play, where the protagonist is a drunken, distracted random member of the audience, that mocks the other actors.
- Player Character misalignment: Desk Jumping: Imagine james bond jump on Ms desk, as Mr Denton does in Deus Ex during a cutscene
    - Disallow desk jumping: Bad because now the players will search for ways how to work around that
    - Ignore it: Bullets just don’t hit companions
    - Best way: Make player and character’s intentions line up
- There is no way to make a machine human interaction resemble a real social interaction
    - -> One solution is to avoid human interactions. E.g. bioshock’s audio logs
    - -> Dialog trees give viable, pre-auditioned options

# Questions/Discussion

- Scripted Story: Nur Beispiele aus shootern. Anderes Beispiel: CnC Red Alert 2 mit Videonachrichten zwischen den Missionen und während des Spiels
- Wie “world narrative” in Funky Trip einbauen bzw World Coherence verbessern? Für mich fühlt sich die Welt dort sehr inkohärent an.
- Beispiel für
    - Scripted Story: Final Fantasy 8/ Jedi Fallen Order
    - World Narrative: Elden Ring
    - Emergent Story: Rimworld, Dwarf Fortress, FTL,
- Beispiel für Story Ordering: Max Payne 1 & 2
