# Excerpt

- What is never communicated to the player, might have never occurred at all
- A game is no more than it communicates
- There is more happening in a game than can be communicated via screens and speakers
- Metaphor: Giving something new the appearance of something familiar to make it easier to understand. Wrap mechanics in fiction to communicate faster.
    - Can imitate real objects (folders, planes, save disk)
    - Cultural archetypes or conventions
    - Came cliches and conventions
    - Logical systems
- Metaphor Vocabulary
    - Only a small subset of the functionality of the real object is actually implemented in the game: Players need to figure out which of the functionalities are missing.
    - Game must create a metaphor vocabulary to indicate which elements are simulated. Stay consistent with that vocabulary
- Noise is signal that fails to transmit meaningful information
- Art introduces visual noise
- Create Looks that are artistically compelling and mechanically clear
- Signal density that players can take depends on skill level
- Visual Hierarchy: More important pieces are highlighted
    - Move things up or down the hierarchy depending on their importance
- Redundancy
    - Homogeneous redundancy: Repeating the same message multiple times
    - Diverse redundancy: The same content but in different ways
    - Passive redundancy: Only send the second message when the first one was missed
- Indirect control: Guide the player without them noticing
    - Nudging: changing player behavior by how choices are presented (blinking button, lit door)
    - Priming: Activate concepts in the players mind to influence their future behavior
    - Social Imitation
- Input: Intent is to achieve synchronization between players intent and game actions
- Mapping relationship between physical input and the actions they control
- Control Exclusivity is the physical relationships between different controls and how they can be used in combination: Buttons that cannot be hit simultaneously
- Control Feel is the moment by moment experience of projectint intent through an interface
- Input assistance: Preprocessing of the input: Intelligently guess what the player is going to do
- Framerate 30 or 60fps

# Questions/Discussions

- Metaphor for imitation: Disketten symbol für speichern
- “Real physics is complicated, everyone knows it. imitating it is an elegant way of creating powerful systems with almost no learning burden”. KSP oder Children of a dead earth? “No learning burden” puh….
- Signal/Noise: Smash Brothers ist visuell sehr überladen. Ähnlich wie Borderlands 3 anstrengend zum anschauen war.
- Mechanical clear visuals: Proteus
- Signal density: Pro Quake players reducing settings
- Natural relationship between distance and size is useful in 3d euclidean space. Check out Hyperbolica
