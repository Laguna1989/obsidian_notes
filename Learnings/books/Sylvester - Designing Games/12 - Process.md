## 12 Process
* Busy idiocy
* The failure of game design process usually springs from deeply rooted assumptions that we don’t know we are making
* Borrowed assumptions
    * Game development takes many ideas from other domains (director, beta phase, preproduction, …)
    * Often those borrowed structures have assumptions associated that are true in the original field, but not for games.
* Inborn assumptions
    * Halo effect - you cannot judge things differentially. A thing is either good or bad
    * Loss aversions (sunken cost fallacy) - hanging on to e.g. a beloved but broken idea
    * Availability heuristic - we respond only to things that we can perceive and ignore everything else.
