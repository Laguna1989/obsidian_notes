# Excerpt

- Values, processes, practice
- A value is an emotionally driven choice about who we want to be, a human quality to aspire to.
- Nobody can fully embody their values, but you can better yourself by trying.
- Suggested Values:
    - Openness: you are open to accept ideas with which you disagree
    - Candor (Freim√ºtigkeit): Having your own ideas and being willing to present them
    - Humility(Bescheidenheit): Hubris makes us overplan or underplan. Humility lets us accept how little we know.
    - Hunger: no matter what we have done, we can do better
