# Excerpt

- A game is fair when no player has an advantage at the start of the game
- When designing a symmetric game, fairness is inherent and of no concern
- The real goal is to balance the strategies
- The core of balance is generating fair play and nuanced decisions. Still it must obey the lore
- Degenerate strategies are the obviously best strategies

- More choices also add more complexity
- Balance depends on Skill level
- It is impossible to balance for all skill levels
- Changing a mechanic changes all involved strategies
- Balancing Methods:
    - Turn the essential knobs as far as possible, then use all secondary knobs for balance
    - Cut as deep as needed to solve problems: Old Thor design in SC2
    - Don’t be reactive: Take time to think about the decisions. Don’t balance emotionally
    - Sometimes, turn it up to 11: Go for balanced, but not necessarily flat games
    - Don’t use feedback to gather suggestions, but for experiences

# Questions/Discussion
