# Excerpt

- Every game that uses challenges (and almost every game does) must deal with player skill
- Skill and comfort zone differ for every player
- Understand especially the lower limit (unbeatable) and upper limits (dull) of skill
- **Deep** games create meaningful play at high skill levels
- Players will try their hardest to break the game and then hate the designer if they succeed (p64)
- **Skill ceiling**: the level of skill beyond there is no improvement
- **Accessibility** create meaningful play at low skill levels
- **Skill range**: the range of skill in which games present a meaningful challenge
- Skills without explicit goals: Players set their own goals, especially in toylike games as sims
- **Reinventing **the game: UT: fiction -> aiming -> map control -> psychic poker
- Manual -> situational -> mental
    - Start by mastering the interface
    - Situational: Manual skills are subconscious but: situational awareness, reading patterns and acting with counter strategies
    - Mental level only reached by experts, competitive committed players
- Create elastic challenges
    - Instead of hit/miss, add a soft zone around the target
    - E.g. highscore multiplication
    - There can be multiple degrees of success, but also multiple degrees of failure
- Good training is invisible
    - Skippable tutorials
    - Catch the player with other things (art, philosophy, …) while he learns
    - One step at a time

- Difficulty adjustments
    - Player selects difficulty
    - Adaptive Difficulty
        - Can work great (e.g. max payne 1) or really bad: rubber banding in Super Mario Kart
- How to handle failure
    - Do not punish the player for failure. Find other ways
        - Avoid hammering the player with long loading screens
        - Better: deprive him of some minor resources or other things
        - Best: Dwarf fortress: Losing is fun
    - Failure traps
        - Losing team just play as dead men
        - softlocking
