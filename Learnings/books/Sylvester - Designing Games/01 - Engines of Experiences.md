# Excerpt

Intro

- A game designer’s job is to craft systems of rules that create a rhythm of puzzle and solution, tension and release.
- How to thread stories and rule into a single system of meaning
- Game design means understanding the trade offs of the decisions
- We will never make a perfect game, but we can get it as close as possible

Engines of Experiences

- Games are composed of **Mechanics**, which define how the game works, e.g.
    - The A button makes mario jump
    - He walks at 1m/s
    - Players alternate taking turns
- During play, Mechanics and players interact to generate **Events**, e.g.
    - Mario hits a wall
    - The ball hits the net
- In other media, events are predefined and always play the same
- In games, events emerge from the interaction of player and mechanics
- => There is a level of indirection, which is our greatest opportunity and the biggest challenge
- To be meaningful, an event must provoke emotions. Most of the time the emotions are subtle enough not to be noticed
- Detecting and understanding subtle emotion is a designer skill
- There are more emotions than just “fun”
- The mind unconsciously but constantly analyzes the situation and triggers emotions when certain conditions are met
- A **emotional trigger** is a thing or observation that causes emotions, e.g.
    - Physical danger
    - Changes in social status or relationships
    - Learning, strengthening, acquisition
    - Family and safety
    - Certain types of natural environments
    - Music, philosophical ideas, and humor/wit
- An event must signal meaningful change of humal value. The difference is in the implications to human beings.
- A human value is anything that is of importance to humans and can shift through multiple states
- Emotions can be anticipating for (before) or responding to (after) and event
- Revealing information is equivalent to changing them (dice roll or card revealed)
- People assign (often false) logical causes to their emotions without realizing it

Basic emotional triggers
- Emotion through learning
    - More obvious -> less pleasure
    - Insight: old pieces now make sense together
- Emotion through character arcs
    - Scripted or emerging from mechanics
- Emotion through Challenge
- Emotion through social interactions
    - Can be additional to the game or baked in (winning against a CPU vs a real match)
- Emotion through Acquisition
    - Diablo Loot mechanics
- Emotion through Music
- Emotion through Spectacle
    - Michael Bay Simulator
- Emotion through Beauty
    - Sunset, beautiful face, …
- Emotion through Environment
- Emotions through Technology
    - New shiny tech that enables new gameplay
- Emotions through primal threats
- Emotions through sexual signals

The fictional Layer
- Fiction adds another layer of emotional meaning to mechanics
    - => Give things a face and people respond to it immediately
- Fiction and mechanics create different emotions
- Fiction and mechanics often interfere, but the ultimate goal should be to have perfect fiction & perfect mechanics combined

Experiences

- **Experiences** are an arc of emotions
- Experiences can be crafted as
    - a combination of emotions for the same experience
    - Juxtaposition (combining seemingly contradicting emotions)
    - Antagonist emotions (with varying effects)

Flow
- Flow is a state of concentration so focused that it amounts to total absorption in an activity
- If a task is too hard or too easy, flow breaks
- Works at all intensity values and emotional valences.

Immersion
- One of the most powerful game experiences
- The mental division between the player and the character softens
- Occurs when the player’s experience mirrors the character’s experience
- To create experience, three parts are needed:
    - Create a flow to strip the player of the real world
    - Create an arousal state using threats
    - Use fiction to label the player’s arousal

Engines of experiences
- A **game** is an artificial system for generating experiences
