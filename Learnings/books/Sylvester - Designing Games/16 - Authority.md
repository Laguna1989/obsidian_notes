# Excerpt

- Creating games requires specialized skills and invested heart, which is a delicate process
- Structure determines how knowledge flows within a team/organization
- Having good people is necessary, but they will all go completely to waste in bad culture or dysfunctional structures.
- Taylorism: One thinking mind and a hoard of dumb laborers. Works only for dumb jobs with not a lot of knowledge involved or when everything is visible. -> does not work for gamedev
- Work like ants (collective complex behavior based on simple local rules) -> works better for gamedev
- The brainpower of every individual is used and local knowledge is put to the best
- The developers natural authority extends to the decisions he can take better than anybody else in the team
- Blame the organizational structure, not the individuals
    - Psychological safety: it is ok to make errors
    - Conways Law: “Organizations which produce systems are constrained to produce systems that match the communication structures of the organization”
- Arrogation: Taking a decision that falls under the natural authority of someone else
    - Micromanagement
    - Root cause of arrogation is missing trust in the subordinates
    - Only solution: Get people you trust and trust them
- Leaders role:
    - Direct people to a goal, instead of taking detailed decisions. Communicate the intent, not the way.
    - The subordinate might do something else than was expected, but as long as the intent is met, this is not a problem.
    - To explain the intent, the leader must know what it is:
        - Understanding the structure of the game and the purpose of the developers work
    - When giving feedback, it should be general and with offers of help
    - The leader does not have to be everywhere and solve every problem
- Subordinates must communicate summaries of newly gained knowledge up

# Questions/Discussions

- What about arrogation on the same level? Just missing communication?
- Conways Law: “Organizations which produce systems are constrained to produce systems that match the communication structures of the organization”
- I disagree with the statement that feedback should be general. Feedback consists of three parts
    - evaluation
    - coaching
    - appreciation
    - To me appreciation and coaching should be precise, otherwise they are not helpful.
    - “Oh ja, du hast so einen tollen Job gemacht” klingt mehr nach Sarkasmus als nach Feedback.
- Trust?
