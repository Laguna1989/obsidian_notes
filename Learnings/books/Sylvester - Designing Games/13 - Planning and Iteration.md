# Excerpt

- The overplanner
    - Nothing plays out as expected
    - Written document vs actual play experience
- The underplanner
- Game design is unusual in the amount of uncertainty (you only know if it makes fun when you play it)
- Iteration: the practice of making short range plans, implementing and testing them and then repeating -> agile
- Get feedback early
- Create a fast feedback loop with real gameplay
- The planning horizon is the length of time the designer plans into the future
- Planning concerns
    - Unoriginal Derivative games can be planned far into the future
    - Original games can only be planned on a short horizon
    - The appropriate planning horizon lengthens during the development
    - When cost of testing is low we should plan for a short horizon
    - Plan deeply when you make conceptual leaps
- Humans have a natural bias towards overconfidence
- Therapeutic planning: Planning not to make progress but to make us feel better about uncertainty
- Groups of people naturally reward the overconfident
- Be aware of hindsight bias
- Test Protocol: A set of rules and procedures to follow when testing
- Self-testing -> chosen playtesters
- Grayboxing: Use placeholder assets
- Premature production: Heading out of grayboxing too early
- Paradox of quality: Accepting poor quality work temporarily leads to a better design overall
    - -> rather go for faster iterations

# Discussions/Questions

- Overplanning: Pen and paper: Kein Abenteuer überlebt die Spieler
- GameJams: Ich sehe uns auf der “underplanner” Seite. Meinungen?
- Wie können wir bei gamejams den feedback loop kurz halten?
- Hindsight Bias: “Blood Sweat and Pixels” ist eine gute Lektüre dagegen
- Wie playtests sinnvoll in Gamejams einbauen?
