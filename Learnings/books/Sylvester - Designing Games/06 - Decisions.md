## 06 Decisions

### Excerpt

* Decisions are the basic building blocks for interactions
* Can be direct (poker), complex (Civ) or flowing (CsGo)
* Decisions are based on emotions (even more than rationale)
* Decisions are the only emotional trigger only present in Games
* Decision Design is Game Design at its finest
* Decisions are about the future
* Something does not have to happen to invoke emotions. The player only needs to sense the possibility of happening
* Wrong Assumption: Anything that does not happen is irrelevant.
* Predictability is essentially for decision making
* Prediction of a possible future needs to be driven by a consistent and comprehensible system
    * Consistent: What works in one situation has to work in another situation
    * Comprehensible: Simple enough for the Player to understand
* There are two types of Decisions: The Pre-designed ones (e.g. story plots) and the emergent ones (based on the game systems)

Predictability and AI

* Some say: Smarter (more complex) AI is better, because it mimics a real system better. But Smarter AI is less predictable, which hurts consistency and Comprehensiveness.
* Informational balancing: The same decision can be trivial or challenging, based on the amount of information.
* Can lead to extreme cases:
    * Information starvation (e.g. gambling games or character selection at the start of the game)
    * Information glut (heartbeat sensor in battlefield).
* Ways to hide information
    * Incomplete information game: chess vs poker
    * Chains of complex cause and effect: think three turns ahead in chess
    * Information in internal states (e.g. real human enemies
    * Information hidden in speed (e.g. doom)
* Metagame information

Decisions and flow

* Decision scope is the amount of thought that a decision requires
* Player skill changes the effective scope of decisions
* Try to avoid flow gaps: typical fiction/mechanic problem
* Try to avoid overflow:


### Questions/Discussion

* Pre-designed Decisions & Information starvation: Vielleicht mag ich deshalb Point&Klick Adventure nicht besonders.
* Beispiele f√ºr information stagnation/information glut?
* Metagame information: Gutes Beispiel Elden Ring
* P139 System shock beispiel. Was hat das mit metagame information zu tun?
* Avoid flow gap: Gears of war reload mechanic
