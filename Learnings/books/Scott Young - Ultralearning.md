# Principles
## Metalearning

* Asses what to learn 
* about 10% of the time should be spent on this
* Reasses what your weaknesses are
* What brings the most benefit?
## Focus

* Procrastination
    * Notice when this happens and what your motives are
    * Avoid procrastination by “I’ll only work on it for 5 minutes and take a break afterwards
    * Pomodoro technique
* Focus
    * Balance between fokus and slacking off (e.g. for creative parts)
    * Assess what works (e.g. learning with music, …)
    * Set Rules for quitting (only quit after a green unittest or when an answer was correct)
## Directness

* Directness is the idea of learning being tied closely to the situation and context you want to use it on
* Direct learning might feel uncomfortable compared to indirect learning
* Transfer: Applying a skill learnt in one context in a completely different context
* Most formal learning is very indirect
* Directness tries to minimize transfer
* Spend a large amount of time on doing the actual thing
* Gaining deep knowledge about a subject will help in later transfer
* Tactics:
    * Project Based learning - Work on a project that you finish
    * Immersive Learning - Learn in an environment that supports the learning
    * Flight Simulator approach - Try to mimic the environment as best as possible
    * The Overkill approach


## Drill



* Practising a very specific subskill
* Sort of contrary to Directness
* Evaluate regularly if you are practicing the right thing
* Direct-Then-Drill: Alternating stages of Practice
* Good ways to apply Drill
    * Time Slicing: Like musicians practicing a short segment
    * Cognitive Components:
    * Copycat: Copy the parts of the exercise from previous work or from other artists
    * Magnifying glass method: Deliberately spend way more time on a specific skill than you would normally do.
    * Prerequisite chaining: start with directness and learn a subskill when you notice you are not good enough
* Drills are supposed to be tough
## Retrieval

* Recalling learnt things from your head and testing yourself
* Difficulty: oft for the harder difficulty, unless it is still possible to do retrieval
* Timing: Slightly delayed pays off most
* taking the test before the class starts can help: paving the road will help you to get to the destination
* Retrieval Tactics:
    * Flashcards
    * free recall
    * take questions instead of answers
    * self generated challenges
    * closed book learning 
## Feedback

* Types of Feedback:
    * Outcome: e.g. grades
    * informative: more specific, e.g. a certain word in a foreign language that causes confusion
    * corrective: how to improve
* Tactics
    * noise cancellation
    * hitting the difficult sweet spot: Adjust the difficulty. You learn nothing when you always fail/succeed
    * metafeedback
    * high intensity rapid feedback
## Retention

* How do we forget?
    * Decay
    * Interference
    * Forgotten Cues
* memory mechanisms
    * spacing: repeat to remember
    * proceduralization
    * overlearning
    * mnemonics
## Intuition

* Rules
    * Dont give up on hard problems easily
    * Prove things to understand them
    * Always start with a concrete example
    * Don’t Fool yourself
## Experimentation
* Experimenting with learning resources
* Experiment with technique
* Experiment with style
* Tactics:
    * Copy, then create
    * compare side by side
    * introduce new constraints
    * superpower: hybrid unrelated skills
    * explore the extremes
