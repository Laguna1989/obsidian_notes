# Excerpt

- Focus on:
    - Identifying Value streams to start the transformation
    - Understanding the work in those value streams
    - Designing the organization according to conways law
    - Enabling outcomes
    - Protecting and enabling the team

Selecting The value stream to start with

- The value stream dictates the difficulty of the transformation and the involved parties
- Pick carefully, because if you are in trouble you do not get many shots
- Focus on early wins to convince others
- Integrate testing into their daily work
- Stop throwing bodies at the problem and improve the way we work
- Brownfield: Already existing project, possibly high level of technical debt, already in production
- Greenfield Project: Start from scratch
- System of Records (HR, ERP, “do it right”) and Systems of engagement (customer facing, “do it fast”). Both can be combined with DevOps. By making downstream projects safer and faster to change, the upstream projects (and often the complete organization) benefit as well.

Start with the most sympathetic and innovative group

- Find Teams that already believe in devops and work with them
- Avoid the big bang “Starting all at once”
- This resembles the “Our Iceberg is melting” plan.
- Demonstrate early wins
- Use change agents
- Steps:
    - Find innovators and early adopters
    - Build critical mass and silent majority
    - Identify the holdouts
- “Culture eats strategy for breakfast”

Understand the work in the value stream

- Improvements can start with incremental work
- Often it is not the tools, but the processes that make things slow
- No single person knows everything, so you need to bring everyone together
- Create a Value stream map
- Focus on:
    - Places where work must wait for weeks or months
    - Places where significant rework is generated
- Aim for one goal (reduced lead time, %CA, …) and set a concrete goal for 3 or 12 months.
- Create a dedicated Transformation team
    - They work outside of the daily business work context
    - The team is hold accountable for a measurable system wide result
        - Members are dedicated to that team instead of 80%/20% splitting
        - Select generalist team members
        - Team members who have long standing and respectful relationship with key aeras
        - Create separate physical and virtual spaces for the team
- Agree on a shared goal with a fixed timeline
    - Reduce budget spent on unplanned work by 50%
    - Teams need to decide on a regular cadence to work on that goal
- Keep improvement Horizons short
- Reserve 20% for unplanned work and Technical Debt
- Increase the visibility of work
- Use Tools to reinforce desired behavior

Conways Law

- Optimize for Speed instead of for money
- Hire EShaped employees
- Fund Products and services instead of Projects
- Design Team boundaries with Conway’s law in mind.
- Create loosely coupled architectures
- Keep Team sizes small

How to get great outcomes by integrating ops into dev

- All the platforms and services should be automated and available on demand without requiring anyone to open or work on a ticket.
- Use the best tools and services available. This means that internal services need to compete with commercial services and.
- Embed ops engineers into service/product teams
    - This also helps with training
- Integrate ops into dev rituals
    - Standup and retrospectives
- Ops tasks should be on the same kanban board

# Discussions & Questions

# Text for the Book Club Week4

- Do you consider yourself in a greenfield or brownfield project/product?
- What are systems of records and systems of engagement that you regularly use? Or do you see devops already applied?
- There have been multiple value stream analyses at EB. Did you take a look at the Value Stream maps and did you agree with the findings?
- What is not clear to me: The actual work is being performed by the teams. How will they interact with the transformation team that is not doing the actual work? I see a big risk of the Transformation team becoming an ivory tower team.
- On the tools reinforcing desired behavior: What tools are you using in your daily work and do they reinforce desired behavior (e.g. easy refactoring)? Do you have a shared prioritized backlog for your product or is it split up for different teams?

# Text for the Book Club Week5

- In which Type of organizational Archetype(funktional, Matrix, Market) do you See us?
- Do you see yourself as I, T or E shaped?
- Which parts from the Conways Law do you recognize from Team Topologies? Which differ?
- How big is your team compared to the two-pizza-rule?
- Regarding automated and available-on-demand Services and platforms: How well do you follow this? E.g. when onboarding new team members (access rights?), when changing your build environment or when performing a release.
- What do you think about our approach of “only using approved tools and services” compared to the suggestion from the book that each team picks the best platform and service for the job?
