# Chapters

## 2. Impostor Syndrome
* Impostor Syndrome was especially evident to me during my PhD. Everyone seemed so smart and seemed to work on really important problems. In fact everyone was struggling with the same basic Math, LaTeX Problems, unhelpful administration, supervisor availability and funding issues.
## 3. The importance of data to convince others
* Good suggestion, but sometimes hard to argue about.
* Falls apart, when discussing with non-technical people or people who have no problem with their ego.

## 4. Interview as often as you can
* Most people avoid unpleasant situations. But 30 “unpleasant” minutes in a job interview can make your life in the long run so much better. Same for salary negotiations.

## 5. Learn to say no
* Always calculate the opportunity cost (what will you not get accomplished if you do Task X?)

## 6. Never say no
* Do not say no directly, but phrase it differently and give reason 

## 7. Finding a Mentor
* Mentors (plural) are a good idea
* Pick them carefully so their and your goals align

## 8. Prototype fast
* Always have a working prototype as fast as possible

## 9. Visibility is everything
* Sharing status updates, can also be a learning blog or a personal blog
* Commenting on public posts
* Be active on design documents (they are actually read alot)
* Participate in code reviews
* Instead of answering directly, ask people to write a public post where you will answer

## 10. Let people fail, help them fall slowly
* Do not be a micromanager

## 11. The Tiebreaker - Reaching consensus
* Leave the ego out of the room
* If you argue, argue intelligently (= with data, see point 3)
* Never start an important discussion with an even number of participants

## 14. Align, Align and align again
* I strongly disagree with this one and the example shows this perfectly. No parent should care about cleaning the house when their kid is starving.

##  15. Give Credit
* Find something useful and start giving credit to the creator
* 
## 16. Share reaponsibilities
* When you recognize a pattern, try to come Up with a process to solve issues
* Title ist a Bit misleading
* 
## 17. Take responsibility and own
* Pick an area you Like and start acting like an owner

## 18. How to disarm assholes
* Personality vs having a bad day
* Ask for support by a third person
* Ignore (and cover the lost parts otherwise)
* Talk to the manager (this is one of a limited number of  “get out of jail for free” cards)
* Change the team
* Change the company

## 19. Adaptability
* Do not work because of fear but because of excitement
* Try to channel negative thoughts into positive ones

##  20.
* Always consider and Research Tools that can Help you do your Job better

##  21. internal Open source
* Open source your project internally/externally to get the Investment. You need

## 22. how to get more headcount
* Do Not Work in unimportant/unimteresting Projects
* Advertise the Project and yourself
* Maintain a Backlog and make it visible
* Seek Feedback and improve yourself
* Find another Team with Management that has faith in you

## 23. Keep track of other teams
* Track what other teams are working on
* This will give you valuable knowledge, but also gives you an idea where you want to work

## 24. Networking
* Try to find time for networking regularly in your day

##  25. Changing teams
* Always consider your options
* You can ask people to be discrete
* Familiarize yourself with the performance deadlines of the company
* Switching after a promotion will avoid losing progress

## 26. How fast to respond to emails/chats
* Lmgtfy 😀
* Acknowleding or get back to it later
* Pointing towards the owner or someone who might know
* Give pointers on how to solve this completely
* Leverage posts to avoid answering the same question multiple times

## 27. One to Ones with the leadership
* One on ones are important. Have them with your manager and your skip manager
* Discuss priority of your current project, do not run status updates
* Ask how you can improve

## 28. Act before Think
* Active thinking vs passive thinking

## 29.  Do not be afraid to take time off
* Take days off and sick days

## 30. Biggest Regrets
* 80000 hours -> [https://80000hours.org/](https://80000hours.org/)
* Take two successful projects, then a risky one (for fun)

## 31. Perfectionism
* MVP: Most valuable product or Minimal Viable product?

## 32. Finding an Ownership Area
* Skill can easily be replaced, while knowledge of a system (and its history can not)
* Value of “job security” and “authority” vs “joy on work” and interesting topics?

## 33. Do not Redesign a working system
* Every project starts super clean and gets ugly over time

## 34. Importance of the culture
* Pick companies with a culture that you can align to and add your own part to it&lt;

## 35. Ambiguity
* Start working on a design document
* I strongly disagree with some of the stuff in this chapter.
* Writing down as much as possible? Someone needs to read that stuff. 

## 36. Hold that question
* Really? -> lmgtfy
* Often you need to do a 10 minute search and you know a coworker can solve your issue in 10 seconds. I would go to ask the coworker.

## 37. Review Discussions
* No no and no. You should care about EVERY part of your code. If you think a review comment does not add value, then discuss it through. People are not giving feedback because they want to be nitpicky, but because they think it makes the code better. 
* Do never ask for more feedback until you have acted on all previous feedback.

## 38. Use your calendar
* Yes. There are excellent tools like doodle and so on.

## 39. Setting Focus Blocks

## 41. Interviews
* Take part in interviews as you will learn a lot

## 42. What to expect from a new managers
* Try to support them

## 43. Dogfooding
* Eat your own dogfood aka test your services

## 45. knowing Terms and Office Jargon
* Make your own list. Internet is too slow and Corporate solutions are too General or too specific

## 46. knowing popular Frameworks
* I disagree. This creates some "Halbwissen" where you do Not Unserstand half of what is important.
* Either you are the expert on a topic or you get No right for any decision!

## 47. never keep all your eggs in one basket
* No, No an No!
* Nobody need those Kind of people. 
* And this is Not a Leader, this is a smartass, who Takes rewards for Others peoples Work.
