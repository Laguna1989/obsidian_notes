# 1 Helping Your Team Inspect and Adapt

1. Set the stage
	- Welcome and appreciation of peoples time
	- restate the purpose and goalof the retro
	- Set a clear time frame
	- invest time in working agreements (values)
2. Gather Data
	- start with hard data: events, metrics, features, ...
	- Don't ignore feelings. They tell what is important to the team. And emotions will not go away
3. Generate Insights
	- Try to understand what has happened and why, based on the gathered data
4. Decide what to do
	- Note down action items
		- Need to be stored in a central place, accessible by everyone
		- Clear assignee (person, role or team)
		- Ideally quantifiable
		- Can explicitly be phrased as experiments
	- Limit the number to a reasonable amount
	- Action Items can also be written down as stories for the next sprint
5. Close the retrospective
	- Gather feedback on the retrospective (either directly or individually)

# 2 A Retro Custom Fit to Your Team

- Learn about the history. Study the context, scan the workspace, check cartoons, whiteboards and other artifacts
- Talk to people
	- what did this iteration produce? what is going on elsewhere in the companty (layoffs/hirings)? What learnings are there from previous retros? What are team members feelings?
- Determine a goal for the retro
	- "find ways to improve our practices" or "understand reasons behind missed targets"
- Determine duration: approximately one hour retro per work-week
- Structure the retro
	- include time for breaks
	- Change rooms for a fresh perspective
	- room layout: U-shape or circle is best. Classroom is worst.A conference table in the middle is a physical barrier that might become a psychological barrier
- Select Activities
	- Activities help with
		- encourage equal participation
		- focus the conversation
		- encourage new perspectives
	- Have a backup (e.g. a short and a long activity)

# 3 Leading Retrospectives

- Be explicit when your are acting as a facilitator and when you are acting as a team member
- Managing Activities
	- Introduce the activity
	- If you do multi-step activities, introduce them step by step (not all at once upfront)
	- While the activity is running:
		- Be open to questions and
		- monitor the room: check for the engery level and if people are talking about the topic or latest movie
	- Debrief the activity (unless the results are not directly used in the next step of the retro)
- Managing Group Dynamics
	- There are more active and more passive people. Try to give everyone an equal voice
	- "We have not heard from X and Y yet. What would you add?"
	- Avoid statements like "you are not listening", "you don't understand" or "I disagree" are not that helpful
	- ask "What happened?", "What can we do differently?", "If we try X a different way, what would happen?"
- Avoid violating working agreements and blaming
	- optional working agreements have no value. There can be strictly limited exceptions, but no optional agreements
	- Blame starts a downward spiral of defensiveness an counter-blame. Listen for the language "You broke the build" or "you are immature".
	- Better: Encourage "I language" from participants, e.g. "I am angry that we missed our target because we had so much trouble fixing the build"
	- Avoid pointing fingers

- Handling emotions
	- You are not responsible for other peoples emotions, but you are responsible for keeping the retro productive
	- Your primary goal is to the interactions as the team as a whole, not to any individual. That does not mean ignoring individual emotions
	- Be prepared for emotions. Examples:
		- **Tears**: offer a box of tissues. Once they are able to speak, ask them "what is happening to you? Can you share it with the team?"
		- **Shouting**:
			- If one person stops shouting, the rest of the people stop participating. Hold up one hand as a stop sign. Once they have stopped say "I want to hear what you are saying, and I can't when you are shouting. Can you tell us without shouting?"
			- If shouting continues talk to the person in private. ask for an agreement to express emotions in a non-threatening way.
		- **Stomping Out**: Let them go, then ask the team "What just happened?". Ask whether it is possible to continue without the leaver. Discuss the departure. If this happens more than once, talk to the person outside of the retro.
		- **Inappropriate Laughther/Clowning**: "I have notice that every time we get to this topic someone tells a joke. What is happening?"
- Managing Time
	- Think about a sound to notice everyone about the end of an activity
	- Have a shorter version of activities as a backup
- Managing You
	- As the retrospective leader you need to stay aware of all the turmoil
	- Ask yourself:
		- What just happened?
		- How much was inside me, how much was outside me?
		- How did the group get here?
		- Where does the group need to go next?
		- What are the three options I have next?
		- What will I offer the group?
	- Try to find a mentor who you have seen monitor emotions in a group successfully.
- Taking your skills to the next level in these areas
	- Working with activities
	- Helping groups reach decisions
	- understanding and managing group dynamics
	- increasing self-awareness
	- creating/using flip charts
	- Practice facilitating other meetings

# 4 Activities to Set the Stage

## Check In

- Set the stage in a retro
- Ask one short question that can be answered with just a word or a short phrase
- Example questions
	- What is one word that describes what you need for yourself from this session?
	- Describe in one or two words what is happening for you at the moment.
	- In one or two words, what are your hopes for this retro?
	- What is one thing that is on your mind?
		- Follow up: What do you need to do to put that concern to the side?
- Do not offer evaluative comments "good" or "wonderful"

## Focus on/Focus Off

- Have a poster with
	- inquiry rather than advocacy
	- Dialogue rather than Debate
	- Conversation rather than Argument
	- Understanding rather than Defending
- Form small groups (<4 persons) and ask them to discuss one of the pairs for a short amount of time
- After that they should present their findings to the team.
- This helps with setting working agreements

## ESVP

Make an **anonymous** poll if participants are in this as
- Explorers: eager to discover new ideas
- Shoppers: look at all information and will take home one useful idea
- Vacationers: not interested in the retro but lucky to get away from daily business
- Prisoners: Would rather be somewhere else
if the majority is vacationers, this should be the topic of the retro
If you have at least one prisoner tell them they can spend their time however they like, but the group will be poorer without their participation

## Working Agreements

- Work in small groups to develop working agreements.
- Let the team select 5-7 agreements.
- Agreements should not be for "business as usual"

# 5 Activities to Gather Data

## Timeline

- Group members write cards to represent significant events and post them in chronological order. Then the group discusses the events to understand facts and feelings during the iteration.
- You can use colored cards to code specific things, e.g.
	- Events: yellow (technical), green (organizational), pink (social)
	- Feelings: sad, challenged, satisfied, cautious, fun, fatigued
	- Themes: team communication, equipment usage, customer relations, engineering practices

## Triple Nickes

- generate many ideas about a specific topic.
- Each person starts with a pen and paper and has 5 minutes to write down ideas. Then the paper is passed on to the next neighbor, who continues on the ideas on this paper. continue until the paper arrives at the original person.
- Debrief questions:
	- What did you notice while writing/reading ideas?
	- What surprised you?
	- what is missing from the list?
	- Which idea(s) should we investigate further?

## Color Coded Dots

- Use sticky dots to show events on the timeline where emotions ran high or low

## Mad/Sad/Glad

- Individual use colored cards or sticky notes to describe times during the project when they were mad/sad/glad

## Locate Strengths

- Team members interview each other about high points on the project. The goal is to understand the sources and circumstances that created those high points

## Satisfaction Histogram

- Team members use a histogram to gauge individual and group satisfaction with practices and processes

## Team Radar

- Track individual and group ratings for specific factors about process and development practices they want to example (can also be values)
- Select a few factors upfront

## Like to like (???)

- Ask team members to write 3 cards for each category
	- start doing
	- continue with
	- stop doing
- have a random juge for each round who selects one of his cards and reads it out. Other team members place one of their cards that matches the judges card (the last card laid down is returned back to the player). The teams cards are shuffled and the judge selects the one he thinks is closest to his card. That card goes to the writers stack. Other cards are discarded.
- after you run out of cards, the person with the most quality cards wins

# 6 Activities to Generate Insights

## Brainstorming / Filtering

- Generate ideas with traditional brainstorming, then test whether each idea is applicable to the current situation

## Force Field Analysis

- Define a desired state, then check for factors that restrain or support the change they want.
- Discuss which factors you can influece

## Five Whys

- Team members group in pairs or small groups to look at one specific issue. They as "why?" five times to get beyond habitual thinking.
- Repeat the question "Why?" 5 times to get to the root cause of a problem

## Fishbone

- Check for factors which are affecting a problem situation. Then look for the most likely causes. Then check how you can influence the causes

## Patterns and Shifts

- Facilitate a discussion looking for patterns of events, behaviors or feelings.
- Also look for shifts (something is going smoothly, THEN something happens and energy drops)

## Prioritze with Dots

- Team members prioritize the top issues, ideas or proposals

## Report Out With Synthesis

- Each small group shares the result of their work. After the final report, everyone looks for common threads and themes to identify what they want to work on.

## Identify Themes

- After "Locate Strengths"
- The pairs interview each other and report what they have learned
- Identify temes
- Cluster cards

## Learning Matrix

- Look at four perspectives on their data to brainstorm a list of issues quickly
- Have four quadrants
	- Smiley 😁 (what did we do well)
	- Frowney 🙁 (what would we like to change)
	- Light Bulb 💡 (what did we learn)
	- Bouquet 💐 (Who do we appreciate)

# 7 Activities to Decide what to Do

## Retro Planning Game

- brainstorm (in pairs or alone) all tasks needed to complete an experiment/improvement or recommendation
- remove redundant Tasks and fill gaps
- Team members sign up for tasks

## SMART Goals

- Focus on the teams attention on developing goals that are "specific, measureable, attainable, Relevant and Timely"
- Goals that are not smart tend to fizzle away

## Circle of Questions

- Team members engage in a question asking and answering process

## Short Subjects

- The team brainstorms lists of ideas for action

# 8 Actions to close the Retrospective

## +/Delta

- The team identifies Strengths (+ = do more) and changes (delta = change) for the next retrospective
- Have a flipchart/whiteboard with two columns for + and delta for this retro

## Appreciation

- Team members appreciate other team members for helping them, contributing to the goal, solving a problem, etc...
- Offering appreciation is optional

## Temperature Reading

- Team members report on what is happening for them and what they want
- hear from others, do not comment
- Elements:
	- Appreciation (how others have contributed)
	- Puzzles (we don't understand but are curious)
	- New Info (anything interesting for the rest of the group)
	- Complaints (with recommendation, what they'd like different)
	- Hopes and wishes (what do we hope for?)

## Helped, Hindered, Hypothesis

- Learn what helped members, what hindered them and get ideas what else to try in a retro

## Return on time Invested

- Ask feedback on whether team members spent their time well
- create a histogram from bad to great
