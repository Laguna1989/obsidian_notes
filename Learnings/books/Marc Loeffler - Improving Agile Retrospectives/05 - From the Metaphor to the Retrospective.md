- Select an interesting theme
- Come up with activities that come up in a specific context

## The Orchestra Retrospective

(Good for a whole year or a longer iteration?)

### Set the Stage

Put together a list of terms relevant for the theme. Try to use only those terms during the retrospective and encourage participants to do so as well.

- Musicians, Conductor
- Conductors baton
- Sheet Music and music stands
- Instruments, Instrument stands and Microphones
- Uniform
- Who plays solos, when to play unison?
- Time, Bar, Volumes
- Instrumental/With singers?

These terms will often generate associations to actual events.

### Gather Data

In the annual general meeting the orchestra decides on the upcoming year, hears the secretary's report.
Everyone acts as a secretary of the orchestra.

Their individual reports
- Are best represented as a timeline
- Contain relevant events
- How they felt during the whole time and the specific events

Ask theme specific questions
- What made you mad about the conductor?
- Which concert trips did you remember particularly well?
- Were there any problems with playing together?
- Are you satisfied with our instruments?
- What bothered you about your sheet music?
- Which solo did you like best?

### Generate Insights

- Use dot voting to select topics to discuss
- As theme specific questions
	- How does this topic sound in in a certain section of the orchestra?
	- Why did that section play a part particularly well?
	- Why was section X unable to master a part?

## Define Experiments

- How can I help section X to master this part?
- What load can I take of another section?
- How can I play the part even better?
- Where can musicians from other sections support better?

## Closing

- Close the retro with listening to some uplifting orchestral music
