# Management 3.0 Model

![[IMG-2024-06-29-194830269.png|center|500]]

- Energize People
	- Those people are the only ones who can react, so it is important to have a motivating environment in which people can give their best
- Empower Teams
	- self-management can only work if the teams have the power and authority to make decisions
- Align Constraints
	- Set clear boundaries and a vision for everyone to follow (avoid the group of headless chickens)
- Develop Competencies
	- Make sure that individuals continue to develop and build competencies
- Grow Structure
	- For an organization to grow, there needs to be some structure
- Improve everything
	- This is about continuous improvement

This Management 3.0 model can be used for a Team or Management Retrospective
