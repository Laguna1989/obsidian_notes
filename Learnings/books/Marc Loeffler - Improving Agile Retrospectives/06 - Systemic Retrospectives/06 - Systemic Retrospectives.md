# Overview

- When teams start to work agile, it works out nicely at first
- After all the low hanging fruits there is little left that the team can improve on themselves
- The progress and benefits from working agile grind to a halt
- Working in a big company makes the team only a small part of a big system
- This imposes quite some limitations to the team's freedom
- Two tools needed for teams are [[06 - Systemic Retrospectives#System Thinking|System Thinking]] and [[Complexity Thinking]]

# Systems

> [!info] System based on Greek "Systema": Composite, made of connected parts, generally designates a totality of interrelated elements

> [!example] The definition of a system is often not clear
> Bar:
> - What exactly is a bar?
> - Are the people part of the bar?
> - Is the beer a part of the bar?
> - What happens when I have drunk my beer? Is it still part of the bar?
> - If I take my bear outside, is it still part of the bar?
> - Is the bar actually a system? What is the goal of the bar?

## Static Vs Dynamic Systems

- Static systems are mostly human-created
- Dynamic systems contain the changes for their own alteration

### Complicated and Complex

![[Structure-Behavior Model]]

# System Thinking

>[!info] Any event is not the result of a single cause but of the interplay of different elements within a system

> [!warning] There is no linear cause-and-effect principle

System Thinking
- is a process
- offers a collection of tools that help us to understand systems
- helps us tackle problems within those systems

## Limitations of System Thinking

- No focus on problematic people
- You cannot realistically analyze social behavior

# Complexity Thinking

> [!note] Complexity thinking is like System thinking including social complexity

> [!danger] Any system with social interactions can not be controlled

> [!quote] Dancing with the system.
> Take a step, then stand back and observe how the system behaves on that change

Small changes might have a tremendous effect (Butterfly effect), while huge changes do not bring any effect at all.

## Management 3.0 Model

![[IMG-2024-06-27-204252021.png|center|500]]

- Energize People
	- Those people are the only ones who can react, so it is important to have a motivating environment in which people can give their best
- Empower Teams
	- self-management can only work if the teams have the power and authority to make decisions
- Align Constraints
	- Set clear boundaries and a vision for everyone to follow (avoid the group of headless chickens)
- Develop Competencies
	- Make sure that individuals continue to develop and build competencies
- Grow Structure
	- For an organization to grow, there needs to be some structure
- Improve everything
	- This is about continuous improvement

This Management 3.0 model can be used for a Team or Management Retrospective

## The ABIDE Model

- **A**ttractors: Thinks, ideas or people to which the system responds positively
- **B**arriers: The system's boundaries
- **I**dentity: Roles and responsibilities in the system
- **D**iversity: Differences between the team members in the system
- **E**nvironment: The system environment
