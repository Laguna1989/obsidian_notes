# Overview

> [!note] Often a big proportion of the time of a retro is spent on discussing the "bad past", instead of the "desired future"

# The Solution Focused Approach

- Based on Family Therapy in the 1970s
- The most important tool is the language

## Problem Talk Creates Problems, Solution Talk Creates Solutions

- If you describe an unpleasant situation from you past, your brain is going through the same emotions
- The same works for situations you have not experienced

> [!quote] Your brain cannot distinguish between past, present or future. It always thinks it is in the present

The precise description of the desired goals can be supported, for example with the following questions:
- What is your goal, what do you want to achieve?
- How will you know that you have achieved the goal? What will be different? What else?
- What will you do differently, when you have reached your goal?
- How will other people recognize that you have reached your goal? How will they react to those changes?
- What do those reactions mean to you?

## Focus on the Better Future

- Problem and solution not always are in direct relation to each other
	- Knowing the exact source and cause of a problem do not itself contribute to the definition of steps towards improvement
	- Who is to blame? How did it get this far? What mistakes were made? -> Those questions do not lead to any improvement
- A focus on the negative aspects
	- Leads to problem-trance
	- Does not directly help with finding a solution
- Looking at the past has value, but not in looking for causes of problems, but for moments in which things were better

## If it Works, Do More of it

- We have done things well in the past (even if there were problems)
- We do not need to be overly creative to find ideas for improvements, we already know things that worked well
- Ask the following questions
	- When was the situation better for you?
	- Are there examples in the past that were similar to your desired future?
	- What was different or special in those moments?
	- What did you contribute that made those moments possible?
	- Who else contributed an how?

## If it is not Working, Do Something Different

- Who in your surroundings knows you and your situation particularly well?
- What would they say was the best way for you to reach your goal?
- If you had any opportunity without limits, how would you reach your goal?
