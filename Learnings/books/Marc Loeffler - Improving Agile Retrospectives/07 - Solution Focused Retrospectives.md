# Overview

> [!note] Often a big proportion of the time of a retro is spent on discussing the "bad past", instead of the "desired future"

# The Solution Focused Approach

- Based on Family Therapy in the 1970s
- The most important tool is the language

## Problem Talk Creates Problems, Solution Talk Creates Solutions

- If you describe an unpleasant situation from you past, your brain is going through the same emotions
- The same works for situations you have not experienced

> [!quote] Your brain cannot distinguish between past, present or future. It always thinks it is in the present

The precise description of the desired goals can be supported, for example with the following questions:
- What is your goal, what do you want to achieve?
- How will you know that you have achieved the goal? What will be different? What else?
- What will you do differently, when you have reached your goal?
- How will other people recognize that you have reached your goal? How will they react to those changes?
- What do those reactions mean to you?

## Focus on the Better Future

- Problem and solution not always are in direct relation to each other
	- Knowing the exact source and cause of a problem do not itself contribute to the definition of steps towards improvement
	- Who is to blame? How did it get this far? What mistakes were made? -> Those questions do not lead to any improvement
- A focus on the negative aspects
	- Leads to problem-trance
	- Does not directly help with finding a solution
- Looking at the past has value, but not in looking for causes of problems, but for moments in which things were better

## If it Works, Do More of it

- We have done things well in the past (even if there were problems)
- We do not need to be overly creative to find ideas for improvements, we already know things that worked well
- Ask the following questions
	- When was the situation better for you?
	- Are there examples in the past that were similar to your desired future?
	- What was different or special in those moments?
	- What did you contribute that made those moments possible?
	- Who else contributed an how?

## If it is not Working, Do Something Different

- Who in your surroundings knows you and your situation particularly well?
- What would they say was the best way for you to reach your goal?
- If you had any opportunity without limits, how would you reach your goal?

## Small Steps Can Lead to Big Changes

- Seating position, lighting
- A small "thank you" or smile can change a relationship
- Questions are important
> [!quote] The one who asks, leads

## Focus on Strengths and Skills

- Whenever we see or hear something, we can decide what we want to focus on. The strengths or the weaknesses

## Trust that Each Person is an Expert in His Situation

- Only those who have a problem can solve it (you can of course offer support)
- Everyone else might not know important details of specific situations

## Keep the Attitude of not Knowing

- Accept your own hypothesis and thoughts, put them aside and to remain open and curious

## Be Patient and Confident

- Questions help the team by stimulating a process

# Example Retro

Based on [[01 - Helping Your Team Inspect and Adapt|The Retrospective Phase Model]]

## Opening

Start with something positive, e.g.
- As every team member to state something that is true and positive
- Ask "what else?"
	- What are you proud of achieving in the last two weeks? And what else are you proud of?
	- What have you done that has helped others? And what else was helpful to others?

## Set Goals

Ask one of those questions:
- What goal do we want to reach?
- What situation do you want to create?
- What would be a large or small change?
- Who will be the first person to notice that you have reached your goal?
- Assume you have reached the goal, What would be different for you?

### Problems into Goals

Sometimes it is easier to talk about problems than about goals or solutions
- Make the team briefly think about goals?
- Then ask "What would be achieved by removing these problems?"
- This is a form of asking "what o you want to have instead?"

### Miracle Question

> [!quote]
> I am going to ask you a rather strange question [pause]. The strange
question is this: [pause] After we talk, you will go back to your work (home,
school) and you will do whatever you need to do the rest of today, such as
taking care of the children, cooking dinner, watching TV, giving the children
a bath, and so on. It will become time to go to bed. Everybody in your
household is quiet, and you are sleeping in peace. In the middle of the night,
a miracle happens and the problem that prompted you to talk to me today is
solved! But because this happens while you are sleeping, you have no way of
knowing that there was an overnight miracle that solved the problem
[pause]. So, when you wake up tomorrow morning, what might be the small
change that will make you say to yourself, “Wow, something must have
happened—the problem is gone!”

### Goal Criteria

- Not a question, but a positive statement
- Not an action but a a situation described in detail
- Not a feeling but something concrete
- Within the teams sphere of influence
- Practical and Measurable

## Find Meaning

- What Do we want to reach the goal for?
- What will be different then?
- What impact would reaching the goal have for you?
- What impact would it have for others? And what else?

### Scaling

- Draw a bar with numbers 0-10 on a whiteboard
- Ask each team member where they are at the moment
- Ask where reaching the goal would put them

## Check Results

E.g. confidence vote
