# Techniques to Become a Better Facilitator

Practice **one** of the techniques until you have mastered them, then pick the next one

## Respect Different Communication Styles

- Treat every participant and communication style with respect
- If there is a lot of repetition, paraphrase to help summarize the topic
- If participants are nervous, ask open questions without steering the discussion in any specific direction
- If a new direction pops up, ask how this new point fits into the current discussion

## Paraphrasing

> [!quote] Repeat what has been said in your own words

- Repeat what you understood
- Then ask "Have I understood this right?" or "Was this what you wanted to say?"

## Support Participants

Sometimes has problems with clearly expressing his idea or a statement is confusing
- Ask targeted questions, like
	- Could you give an example?
	- How come?
	- What do you mean by?
	- Could you draw that for me?

## Stacking

If people are talking all over

- Say "Everyone who has something to say, please raise your hand"
- Decide on a running order
- Only one person is allowed to speak at a time, this is an exclusive right to speak
- After all participants from the stack have spoken, ask if there are any new points, and start from the top

## Encourage

If people are holding back, leave work to others or are naturally more introverted

- Who else has an idea?
- Can someone give me an example of this point of view?
- Would someone who has not yet spoken like to comment on this?
- Are there any questions about this topic?
- How could we get to the heart of this?
- Who want's to play devil's advocate for this idea?

The idea is to give someone the opportunity to make his opinion heard

## Feedback Emotion

Lots of people have problems showing their emotions. However, emotions have direct effect on all participants.

If you notice any strong emotion, the first step is to feed it back directly in the form of a question.

- It seems that your are worried/concerned/angry/.... Am I right?
- I can hear in your voice that you are angry/frustrated/sad/happy/content/...
- I get the feeling that this situation is overwhelming for you. Is that true?

In the beginning, talking about emotions will feel odd. The more often you to it, the more it will become part of normal discussions

## Intended Silence

- Perhaps someone is just about to speak and needs a few seconds to get the thoughts together
- Concentrate on the speaker and don't say anything and don't nod your head
- Raise your hand in case anyone wants to break the silence.

## Listen for Common Ground

- State the differences, then state the common assumptions
- This is a good foundation for further discussion

# Visual Facilitation

- Draw and Write in Black
- Draw a frame to contain everything
- Write important text in textboxes
	- First the text, then the box
- Draw all sides of a box individually
- Never Draw through letters
- Avoid BLOCK CAPITALS
- Improve your handwriting
- Use visualizations

**TODO** Draw a frame image

# Visual Retrospective Ideas

## Speedboat Retro

- Like the Sailboat, but just the anchor and the wind

## Trading Cards

Great for introducing newly formed teams
- Each participant gets a card, a marker and some time to prepare a trading card for themselves.
- Exchange cards randomly
- Each participant tells the others about the card they are currently holding

## Perfection Game

Gather feedback about a particular topic (how was the retrospective, how was this presentation, ...)

- Draw an axis from 1 to 10
- Every participant gets to write a card that contains
	- The score on the axis
	- What was really good?
	- What can be done to increase the score?

## Force Field Analysis

Collect all the forces that support or hinder a specific change

**TODO picture from force field analysis**

# Internal or External Facilitators?

- Internal
	- No additional cost
	- Knows the people and the processes
- External
	- He is neutral
	- Avoid playing two roles
	- There might be nobody willing to run retros
	- Can be more experienced than an internal facilitator

As an internal Facilitator, clearly indicate which role you are in.
If you have two teams, you can pair and exchange Facilitators for the other team's retro.

# After the Retro is before the Retro

- Retros are performed at regular intervals
- Take pictures of the visual artifacts of the retro for future reference
- Post the Action items in a very visible place (e.g. coffee machine)
