# Overview

- When teams start to work agile, it works out nicely at first
- After all the low hanging fruits there is little left that the team can improve on themselves
- The progress and benefits from working agile grind to a halt
- Working in a big company makes the team only a small part of a big system
- This imposes quite some limitations to the team's freedom
- Two tools needed for teams are [[06 - Systemic Retrospectives#System Thinking|System Thinking]] and [[Complexity Thinking]]

# Systems

> [!info] System based on Greek "Systema": Composite, made of connected parts, generally designates a totality of interrelated elements

> [!example] The definition of a system is often not clear
> Bar:
> - What exactly is a bar?
> - Are the people part of the bar?
> - Is the beer a part of the bar?
> - What happens when I have drunk my beer? Is it still part of the bar?
> - If I take my bear outside, is it still part of the bar?
> - Is the bar actually a system? What is the goal of the bar?

## Static Vs Dynamic Systems

- Static systems are mostly human-created
- Dynamic systems contain the changes for their own alteration

### Complicated and Complex

# System Thinking

>[!info] Any event is not the result of a single cause but of the interplay of different elements within a system

> [!warning] There is no linear cause-and-effect principle

System Thinking
- is a process
- offers a collection of tools that help us to understand systems
- helps us tackle problems within those systems

>[!hint] Work out CLDs and keep them for reference in the next Retro

> [!hint] Tips for CLDs
> - Always use Nouns for variable names
> - Use Variables that are quantitatively measurable
> - Take unintended effects into account (increase flow might get higher productivity but also increased stress?)
> - Balancing Loops always have a goal. The goal must be part of the loop
> - If a connection is requires too much explanation, either rename or insert an intermediate step
