# Overview

- When teams start to work agile, it works out nicely at first
- After all the low hanging fruits there is little left that the team can improve on themselves
- The progress and benefits from working agile grind to a halt
- Working in a big company makes the team only a small part of a big system
- This imposes quite some limitations to the team's freedom
- Two tools needed for teams are [[System Thinking]] and [[Complexity Thinking]]

# Systems

> [!info] System based on Greek "Systema": Composite, made of connected parts, generally designates a totality of interrelated elements
