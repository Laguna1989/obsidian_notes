## Phase 1 Set The Stage

- Mentally pick up participants
- Preparing the ground
- Potentially review the team charta
- Well invested time, because
	- minimize the risk of someone not speaking
	- make sure everyone feels like they are in a safe environment
	- get everyone present and clear their heads

## Phase 2 Check Hypothesis

- Review last iteration hypothesis
- See how experiments went

## Phase 3 Gather Data

- The actual looking back
- Collect hard facts but also emotions

## Phase 4 Generate Insights

- Why did these things happen?
- Try to get to the root cause of problems or things that went well

## Phase 5 Define Experiments

- Formulate ideas
- Agree on the things the team wants to do
- Phrased as experiments as you might not know if they work out

## Phase 6 Closing

- Spend a few minutes on a short review and thank the participants for their time

# Finding Activities for Each of the Phases

See ![[Retrospectives#Resources]]

# The Prime Directive

> [!hint] Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available and the situation at hand
