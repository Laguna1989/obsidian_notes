# Phase 1 Set The Stage

- Mentally pick up participants
- Preparing the ground
- Potentially review the team charta
- Well invested time, because
	- minimize the risk of someone not speaking
	- make sure everyone feels like they are in a safe environment
	- get everyone present and clear their heads

# Phase 2 Check Hypothesis

- Review last iteration hypothesis
- See how experiments went

# Phase 3 Gather Data

- The actual looking back
- Collect hard facts but also emotions

# Phase 4 Generate Insights

- Why did these things happen?
- Try to get to the root cause of problems or things that went well

# Phase 5 Define Experiments

- Formulate ideas
- Agree on the things the team wants to do
- Phrased as experiments as you might not know if they work out

# Phase 6 Closing

- Spend a few minutes on a short review and thank the participants for their time
