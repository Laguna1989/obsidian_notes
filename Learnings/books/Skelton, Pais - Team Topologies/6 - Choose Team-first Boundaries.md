# Excerpt

- Find a way of organizing boundaries
- Tightly coupled architecture negatively influences the capabilities of teams
- Worse than a monolith: a distributed monolith
- Monolith types:
    - Application monolith large application with many dependencies
    - “Joined at the database” Monolith: multiple applications/services coupled to the same database
    - Monolithic build: One gigantic CI
    - Monolithic Release: multiple components/services bundled into one release
    - Monolithic Model: Force a single domain model onto multiple contexts
    - Monolithic thinking: one size fits all regarding tools, technology and implementation approaches
    - Monolithic workspace: single office pattern layout
- Fracture plane: a natural seam in the software that allows for splitting wrt:
    - Business domain bounded context
    - Regulatory compliance
    - Change cadence
    - Team location
    - Risk
    - Performance

# Questions

- Which of the monoliths described on pages 113f do you recognize in/around your team?

# Text for Book Club Post

Hi everyone to the seventh week of the book club. After the break from last week we will read Chapter 6 “Chose Team-first boundaries” (pages 111 - 130).

After the Team Topologies from the last chapter, this chapter is about the boundaries of Teams. This includes the description of antipatterns (monoliths) as well as possible fracture planes, which can serve as a guidance on how to split teams.

This week I would like to discuss:

- Which of the monoliths described on pages 113f do you recognize in/around your team?
- Which aspects do you see in your current team as possible fracture planes?
