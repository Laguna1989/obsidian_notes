# Text for Book Club Post

Hello everyone for the 9th week of the book club. This is already the last chapter of the book before the conclusion.

After the team topologies from chapter 6 and the team interaction modes from chapter 7, this chapter describes how team structures can evolve during time. Different teams can evolve into different team topologies in different parts of the organization at different times to match the respective context and purpose. Additionally, various triggers are given that can be used as indicators when an evolution should happen.

This week I would like to discuss with you:

- Which of the triggers do you see in your current team/setup?
- Do you currently use team interactions as senses (as suggested) and if so, how?
