# Excerpt

- If the architecture of the system and the architecture of the company are at odds, the company wins
- Design alternatives are effectively not considered as the communication channels do not exist
- Team assignments are the first draft for an architecture

- Keeping Things decoupled and Team-scoped
- Technical people need to be involved in organization design, too
- Does the team structure minimize the number of communication paths per team?
- Everyone does not need to communicate with everyone
- Tools used by the teams need to match the setup
    - separate (instances) of tools or merge them if needed
    - distinguish between shared tools and (team-)individual tools
- Reorganization for management reasons should be a thing of the past!

# Questions

- Can you share some examples where you or your team felt limited or constrained in designing a system or using a communication channel?
- Do You feel that in your current setup (enough) technical people are involved in the organization’s design and setup?
- Can you share an experience where the tools you use are not actively supporting you?

# Text for Book Club Post

Welcome back to the second week of the book club. This week we will read chapter 2: “Conway’s Law and why it matters” (pages 15-30).

While Conway's law was briefly explained already in the introduction, this chapter goes into more detail. It describes how the organizational structure prescribes the architecture of the software to be developed and gives examples for this. Additionally some tips are given on restructuring and tools.

This week I would like to discuss with you:

- Can you share some examples where you or your team felt limited or constrained in designing a system or using a communication channel?
- Do You feel that in your current setup (enough) technical people are involved in the organization’s design and setup?
- Can you share an experience where the tools your team uses are not actively supporting you?
