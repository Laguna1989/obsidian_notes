- Ask team members to write 3 cards for each category
	- start doing
	- continue with
	- stop doing
- have a random juge for each round who selects one of his cards and reads it out. Other team members place one of their cards that matches the judges card (the last card laid down is returned back to the player). The teams cards are shuffled and the judge selects the one he thinks is closest to his card. That card goes to the writers stack. Other cards are discarded.
- after you run out of cards, the person with the most quality cards wins
