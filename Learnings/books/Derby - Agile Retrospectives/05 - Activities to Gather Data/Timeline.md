- Group members write cards to represent significant events and post them in chronological order. Then the group discusses the events to understand facts and feelings during the iteration.
- You can use colored cards to code specific things, e.g.
	- Events: yellow (technical), green (organizational), pink (social)
	- Feelings: sad, challenged, satisfied, cautious, fun, fatigued
	- Themes: team communication, equipment usage, customer relations, engineering practices
