Phase Model for Retrospectives
1. Set the stage
	- Welcome and appreciation of peoples time
	- Restate the purpose and goal of the retro
	- Set a clear time frame
	- Invest time in working agreements (values)
2. Gather Data
	- Start with hard data: events, metrics, features, ...
	- Don't ignore feelings. They tell what is important to the team. And emotions will not go away
3. Generate Insights
	- Try to understand what has happened and why, based on the gathered data
4. Decide what to do
	- Note down action items
		- Need to be stored in a central place, accessible by everyone
		- Clear assignee (person, role or team)
		- Ideally quantifiable
		- Can explicitly be phrased as experiments
	- Limit the number to a reasonable amount
	- Action Items can also be written down as stories for the next sprint
5. Close the retrospective
	- Gather feedback on the retrospective (either directly or individually)
