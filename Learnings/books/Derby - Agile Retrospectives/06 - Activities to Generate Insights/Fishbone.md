# Steps

- Draw a fishbone diagram and put the problem to the fish's head
	- Include the [[Five Whys]] as the branches of the fishbone (this can also be other categories)
- Brainstorm factors for each category
- Add more branches if required
- Look for items that appear in more than one category

# Notes

> [!note] If a lot of the issues originate outside of the teams sphere of control, finding the sources via a fishbone might not be the best idea

 > [!note] This works best if the issue are under the control of the team
