# 1 helping your team inspect and adapt
- Set the stage
	- Welcome and appreciation of peoples time
	- restate the purpose and goalof the retro
	- Set a clear time frame
	- invest time in working agreements (values)
- Gather Data
	-   start with hard data: events, metrics, features, ...
	- Don't ignore feelings. They tell what is important to the team. And emotions will not go away
- Generate Insights
	- Try to understand what has happened and why, based on the gathered data
- Decide what to do
	- Note down action items
		- Need to be stored in a central place, accessible by everyone
		- Clear assignee (person, role or team)
		- Ideally quantifiable
		- Can explicitly be phrased as experiments
	- Limit the number to a reasonable amount
	- Action Items can also be written down as stories for the next sprint
- Close the retrospective
	- Gather feedback on the retrospective (either directly or individually)


# 2 A Retro Custom fit to your team
- Learn about the history. Study the context, scan the workspace, check cartoons, whiteboards and other artifacts
- Talk to people
	- what did this iteration produce? what is going on elsewhere in the companty (layoffs/hirings)? What learnings are there from previous retros? What are team members feelings?
- Determine a goal for the retro
	- "find ways to improve our practices" or "understand reasons behind missed targets"
- Determine duration: approximately one hour retro per  work-week
- Structure the retro
	- include time for breaks
	- Change rooms for a fresh perspective
	- room layout: U-shape or circle is best. Classroom is worst.A conference table in the middle is a physical barrier that might become a psychological barrier
