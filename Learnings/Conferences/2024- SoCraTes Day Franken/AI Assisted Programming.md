- Only people living in the deep sea do not know about AI
- run large language models locally -> [ollama](https://ollama.com)
	- `ollama serve`
	- `ollama run llama3`
	- `talk with it`
- Current models vary greatly and "best" changes ~ weekly
- llama3 is best enough, but worse than chatgpt4
- [deepseek coder 2](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-coder-v2) is a good one for coder
- Local model can be run with local IDE, but quality is not so good
- Modern models already talk with the compiler and check if the respective code already compiles

- Will the programming language as an intermediate step go away?
