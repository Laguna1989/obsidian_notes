Based on ![[COACH SS2022 - Lesson 11 - Leading Change - Peter Koning.pdf]]

- *Change* vs *Improvement*?
    - Improvement: positive, change: neutral or even radically negative
    - Improvement: gradual, change abrupt
    - Change can be forced, Improvement is intrinsic
    - Improvement for some, change for others (my improvement can be your job loss)
- Talk is mostly about leading improvement
- 8 Steps by Kotter (Our iceberg is melting)
    - Create a sense of urgency
    - Build a guiding Coalition
    - Form a strategic vision
    - Enlist a volunteer army
    - Enable Action by removing barriers
    - Generate Short term wins
    - Sustain Acceleration
    - Institute Change
- Is change plannable and predictable?
    - Can plan steps towards change, but cannot plan the outcome
    - Change in an organization is “at least complex”
- Most of theories are based on waterfall approach to change
    - But: You have to adapt along the way
    - You need an empirical approach
- How do you change people
    - You cannot change people, best you can do is align or motivate or help people to improve
    - People don’t like to be changed
    - People like improvements
    - Don’t focus on the people that do not want to change
- If you propose change there is a bell curve. Some are very positive, some very negative. Big center will wait and see
- What not to do:
    - No Top Down approach
    - Not letting people figure it out on themselves
    - Don’t enforce everything
    - Don’t delegate
- What to do:
    - Start with a tiny team
    - Let this one team make a big step and propose and promote that to others
    - Viral improvements
    - Plan-Do-Check-Act
    - If one single team is blocked -> step 2: Remove impediments (e.g. from other teams, management, …)
    - After new way of working is established focus on “laggers” (~25%)
    - When the elephant is too big, try to cut the elephant
    - Measure Success:
        - Focus on actual helpful measurements. Hard KPIs
        - You cannot measure a mindset change.
