# Reasons for Losing the Ability to Listening

	- There is no more a premium on precise and accurate listening

- The art of conversation is dumped for personal broadcasting
- Media constantly screaming at us

# This is Very Dangerous

- Only conscious listening creates understanding
- A world without listening is a very scary place
