- C++ divided into basic language, classes and templates
- C++ STL
- C++20 is “postmodern” C++
- Where to learn:
    - Books
    - Online courses and videos
    - Trainings with c++ trainers
    - Blogs and other resources
- Don’t play the guessing game

# Teaching C++

- Basics first
- Do not start with
    - Os specifics
    - [[Design Patterns MOC]], graphics, sounds, network, …
- Structured approach: how do topic x and topic y relate, and which one should be taught first?
- Keep theory to a minimum
- Plenty of examples
