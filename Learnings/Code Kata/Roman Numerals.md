# Summary

- Convert Roman numerals into Arabic numbers
- Good for practicing [[Triangulation]] and [[Fake it til you make it]]

# Notes

- The naive approach is to process the input on a char level. This leads to increased complexity with subtraction. Allowing processing of combined numerals (e.g. `IV`) allows for way less complicated code
- Very elegant approach: string replacement and counting length
