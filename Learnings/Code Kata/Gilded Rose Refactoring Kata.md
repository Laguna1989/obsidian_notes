# Summary

- Focused on
	- refactoring a pathologically complicated codebase
	- boolean logic, [[DeMorgan's Law]], inverting `if`conditions

# Notes

- I personally like to start with a set of [[ApprovalTests]]. This allows to focus on the refactoring part. The original kata starts without test coverage, which is a completely different topic that I like to keep separated.
