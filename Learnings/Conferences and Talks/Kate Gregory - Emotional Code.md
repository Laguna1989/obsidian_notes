# What to aim for

## Confidence

* Delete Things you donâ€™t need (and use source control to revert if needed)
* Take the time to clean up - it might help me and others
* Comments and useful names explain your thinking
* remove obsolete and handrolled things


## Humility
* Use libraries - include a link to documentation if it is not stl
* Gentle comments - When things are not obvious, leave some help for your future self or coworker
* Helpful names for everything
* You are as good as me and will understand if I explain it to you
## Generosity

* Clean engineering to make next time easier 
    * Well thought out encapsulation
    * appropriate level of abstraction
* Take the time to clean up
* Information sharing - my job is safe if everyone can do this and the company stays in business

## Hard Working

* I do this without being asked for
* My code compiles, links runs and passes the tests
    * No warnings, no exceptions on startup, no stray files left behind
    * Tests are complete and well documented
* I use modern constructs, libraries and tools
    * I have the mentality of always learning
    * Toos not for the sake of tools
* Commitment to the future
    * For myself and for the Teams success

## Call to action

* Care about those who write/wrote the code you maintain
* Show condifence, be generous and empathic
* Choose which emotions to show in your code
