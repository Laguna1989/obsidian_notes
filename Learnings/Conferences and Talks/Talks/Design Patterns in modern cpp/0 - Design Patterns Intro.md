# Solid Design Principles

![[SOLID Design Principles]]

# Gamma Categorization (from GoF book):

- Creational patterns (builder applies here)
	- Wholesale creation (single call) vs piecewise (step by step)
- Structural Patterns
	- Concerned with class members, patterns are wrappers mimicking the underlying class interface
	- Importance of good API design
- Behavioural Patterns
	- No central theme
